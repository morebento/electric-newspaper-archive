Around me there was nature'sintensity -  the sheer size of the granite mountains or the massive scars gouged intothe landscape by glaciers in past times.<p>Some years ago the Norwegian Government had hired artists fromall over to create sculptures to symbolise various aspects ofNorway's culture and history.  These sculptures have been placedin towns and locations right across Norway, and wherever I went,I was sure to get strong comments from the residents about thesculpture in the local area.  Two of the sculptures that I stillrecall are the head that almost magically inverts as you walk around it(near a place called Eggum) and a 15-metre statue of a man in the harbourat Mo-I-Rana. Thislast statue was most striking as, on the morning I saw it, therewas a soft mist on the harbour and the water was glass smooth,creating ghostly reflections right across the harbour.<p>One of the most popular tourist spots in Oslo isVigelands Park.  In this park are hundreds of carvedstatues of naked people.  The vast majority of the statues are of people entwined together, and in the centre of the park is amassive column made up of naked people.  Over the many yearsthese statues have been on display, thousands of people haveplaced their hands on certain anatomical parts of the statues tobe photographed.  It is fascinating to see which parts havebecome the darkest over time as they have been handled by so manypeople.<p>At the other end of Norway, in Kirkenes, I had the great fortuneof being able to see over 100 works of art from churches inRussia, that were being restored by the new "historical centre"in the city.  All of these paintings had, over the centuries,become blackened with soot from fires in the churches andbuildings in which they were kept.  Most of these precious paintingshad been restored to their original brilliance and are shortly due to bereturned to the Russians.<p>One of the natural beauties that is impossible to miss in the"top half" of Norway during July is the midnight sun.  To sit ontop of a hillside and watch the sun gliding horizontally alongthe horizon is a experience to remember.  I was also intrigued tofind that I needed no more than 4 hours sleep each "night" duringthis visit, and did not end as tired as I thought I might.  Another of the natural sights to leave you speechless are theglaciers - especially the Svartisen Glacier, which is the secondlargest glacier in Norway.  This glacier covers some 375 squarekilometres, and it can be viewed from many vantage points.  Ifyou are very keen it is possible to arrange walks on the glacierwith the Norwegian Mountain Touring Association!  I was luckyenough to have a trip onto the top of the new Storglomvatn dam,which takes water runoff from the Svartisen glacier forhydroelectricity generation.  It's not often one can sit at thetop of a massive dam on top of mountains, looking at the trulymind-blowing sight of a glacier and sheets of ice in the dam, allbeing reflected in the glassy still surface of the water. The dayI was there was such a day - and it was warm enough to wearT-shirts.<p>Now, for those considering a trip to Norway, some basic house-keeping tips. Living costs in Norway are higherr than in Australia.Be prepared for food costing 50% more than here.  If youwant to drive,  then petrol costs can be as high as $2/litre out inthe countryside.  Bus, train and boat costs are fairly good -especially if you get a Scanrail ticket.  This rail ticket willalso give you concessions on many boats and buses.  There areconcessions of 25%-50% for group tickets with most transportcompanies  - and a group is 2 or more people!  Accommodationcosts will vary considerably - depending on style, time of yearand time of week.  <p>Norway may be an expensive place to visit if you don't haverelatives or friends to stay with,  but if you want to be awe-struck on a daily basis - what a place to go!<br clear=all><p><CENTER><hr noshade><A HREF="../holidays/index.html"        onMouseOver="waxon('holidays');        statuson('holidays'); return true;"        onMouseOut="statusoff(); waxoff('holidays');        return true;"><IMG name=holidays SRC="../buttons/butt_holidays_off.gif" ALT="holidays" WIDTH="140" HEIGHT="32" BORDER="0"></a><A HREF="../home/index.html"        onMouseOver="waxon('home');        statuson('home'); return true;"        onMouseOut="statusoff(); waxoff('home');        return true;"><IMG name=home SRC="../buttons/butt_home_off.gif" ALT="home" WIDTH="140" HEIGHT="32" BORDER="0"></a><hr noshade></CENTER><p><A HREF="http://www.electric.on.net">http://www.electric.on.net</A><p>&copy; This work is subject to copyright.
