Every one of our friends had been on a houseboat holidayand every single one of them had returned raving. That was hardly a goodstart as we're the sort of people who bitterly resist doing whatever isfashionable amongst our friends. We haven't even seen "The Piano" yet. <p>Then it was the safety aspect. "Children drown in the river," she observedevery time I brought the subject up. "Yes," I thought to myself, "but itdoes not follow necessarily that ours will." I did not venture this aloud.<p>"And it might be a holiday for you but I'll be cooking and cleaning andwatching the children. Anyway, I'm not sure I want to be cooped up on ahouseboat with other people for a week or more with no hope of getting offuntil we get back to wherever we started from."<p>So it was with some apprehension I heaved the first box of provisions ontothe boat moored alongside ten or twelve of its siblings at the Liba-LibaHouseboat base just outside of Renmark.<p>How we came to book a Liba-Liba houseboat was quite another story. I'dresearched the houseboat thing quite thoroughly, I thought, in the SouthAustralian Tourism Commission's Shorts book and the Yellow Pages amongother places. There were some houseboats available for hire which seemed tobe the inland maritime equivalent of a four bedroom suite at the Hyatt.Both the bride and I were drawn somewhat in that direction. Dad, on theother hand, had hired Liba-Liba houseboats before and he was persuasive.<p>"Son," he said (he always calls me ‘son' when serious advice is about to bedispensed), "the Liba-Libas have paddle-wheels on the back - they're muchquieter - also much cheaper to run. And the Murray is sensational upstreamfrom Renmark. Lots of places to moor and the cliffs are fantastic."Actually, the cliffs are awesome  - but awesome is not a word which springseasily to the lips of my 70 year-old father. <p>So it was one of  those warm-bordering-on-hot river days under a steel-greysky when we manoeuvred our houseboat out of the berth, along the creek andinto the Murray River proper. We'd just had a 30 minute crash-course inriver navigation, elementary chart reading, maritime courtesy, tying-up andradio operation. We were also vaguely acquainted with the pumping system,the gas system, the generator, the dunnies and the lighting system. Quitefrankly, for the first five minutes or so, the complete lassitude of aresort island holiday was looking pretty good.<p>Moments later we chugged into the main channel, lined up on right side ofthe river and headed upstream to Whirlpool Corner.  The mighty Murray castits spell and to this day the spell remains unbroken. <p>The Murray River is incredible. 2,820 kilometres miles long, it rushes outof the high country and eases itself down to the sea with the confidencethat comes with maturity and power. Even after 200 years of abuse by whiteman, you can't help the feeling that human beings are just carpetbaggers inthe presence of royalty. The Murray River irrigates a goodly part ofAustralia one way or another and  whatever else you might say, one thing istrue. The Murray dies and we die. It's that simple.<p>Upstream from Renmark though, the Murray looks in pretty good shape. And wewere starting to get in pretty good shape ourselves. The expansive frontdeck of our houseboat was an entertaining area complete with outdoorfurniture, a gas barbecue and a broad sunshade. Everything had been thoughtof - including a sliding window in front and at the side of the wheel,which was inside the cabin on the starboard side. This meant that whoeverwas "on watch" could join the conversation. The sturdy safety-rail whichran around the entire boat convinced the bride that she could relax. Themale members of the crew needed no convincing at all. "Drinks anyone?"<p>The Liba-Liba navigation system consists of series of sequentially numberedlarge signs attached to trees at regular intervals along the banks. Thesenumbers correspond to numbers on the simple but effective chart provided bythe Liba-Liba people. We took a pair of binoculars (most important!) andthe kids literally fought with each other to spot and report the numbersthereby plotting our passage. <p>The navigation system gave everyone on board a way of really discoveringthe stretch of Murray we had chosen to traverse. Between Renmark and wherewe (very reluctantly) turned back, we steamed past an old Japanese POWcamp, a sunken barge from the river days of old, an aboriginal canoe treeand a wildlife reserve. Yawning creek mouths beckoned but our chart wasvery firm on the subject of creeks. These were navigable only in thealuminium dinghy tied to the rails on the back deck.<p>The houseboat was a dream to handle. I had thought, in mycharacteristically pessimistic fashion, that steering would become a chore.Not so. The gentle humming of the motor and swish-swish of the paddle-wheelaids contemplation and reflection. You do need to concentrate a little butit's the sort of concentration that's inherently relaxing. Like building amodel. In any case, there is always a queue of people wanting a turn. Icame to quite value my "watches" as times when I could lose myself in mythoughts. It was easy -and a lot of fun -  to imagine life on a MurrayRiver paddle-steamer at the turn of the century. <p>Dad was right about the paddle-wheels. We were overtaken, quite often, bymany of the more modern houseboats powered by twin outboards. You couldhear them coming for miles. But ours was a gentler noise, much more inharmony with the river and the life that teemed in and around it.<p>Take a book on Australian native birds. We didn't and we regretted it. TheMurray's abundant bird life is source of endless fascination and the mostfrequently asked question during our trip was "What sort of bird is that?"In the face of seemingly endless variety our ornithological knowledge, suchas it was, wilted.. A family of tiny swallows had nested underneath ourboat and we became quite protective of them as the days meandered on -mainly, I think, because we all knew what sort of birds they were. Andabove, squadrons of pelicans banked and turned in the pale pink sunsets. Wecould pick pelicans. We'd seen "Storm Boy".<p>The next most frequently asked question was "Cold beer, white or red?" And,oh, what a joy to be in South Australia! We had thoughtfully stocked up onsome crisp little whites for the afternoon, some pugnacious reds for ourmany barbecues and a range of beers to cleanse the palate as required. AllSouth Australian produce and all of a standard the rest of the world canonly dream about! We spent most of our early afternoons sitting on thefront deck, nursing a cold beer or a wine, chatting, listening to some ofour favourite tapes, nibbling on savouries and all the while chugging awayin the middle of a picture-perfect watercolour. <p>Our practice was to be tied up to the bank by about 3.00pm. All along theriver there are any number of perfect spots at which to moor and theprocedure is quite simple. Once you have identified your spot and you'resure there's enough water underneath the boat, you nose the houseboat very,very gently into the bank. You tie up to the trees (which are a necessaryfeature of the perfect mooring spot), lower the gangplank and shut down themotor. You can then explore the bush, or prepare for a night-time barbecueon the bank. <p>Dusk throws a blanket of stillness over the Murray. It is a time when theriver-world takes on deep shades of blue and brown. The slow-moving riverbecomes a mirror to the banks and the sky and the brilliant sheen is brokenonly by the soft plop of a jumping fish or a puff of evening breezescuttling across the water.<p>There is something very consoling about a standing around a fire on thebank at night with your comfortable houseboat only metres away. The kidslove a fire too. But please, dig a hole for your fire, don't make it toobig, don't chop down trees for firewood and bury your fire thoroughly andtake your rubbish with you before you move on. Too often houseboaters leavethe remains of their campfires on the bank for others to clean up. Unlessthis practice changes, it won't be too long before the simple pleasure of afire on the bank at night is denied everyone on account of thethoughtlessness of a few. Our Liba-Liba houseboat had a shovel on board. Inoted that with approval.<p>I can't begin to describe the river. There's just too much. There areancient forests of drowned eucalypts, standing in patient silence until theend of time. There are towering cliffs, whose ochre-like colours vacillatein the ever-changing light. There are kilometres  of reeds and treesweeping gently into the river. And above there's the sky, changing athousand times a day. There's no end to the beauty and there's no point inme talking about it. You simply must go yourself.<p>The thing is that our houseboat holiday was tremendous fun and tremendouslyrelaxing at the same time. Cooking was very much part of the fun and therewas very little on board that needed more than a wipe with a sponge everynow and then. The bride loved the houseboat holiday as much as I did andremarkably, both kids can't wait for the next one.<p>This story is about a Liba-Liba Houseboat holiday but there are many, manyequally fine houseboat operators. It's really down to what you want. Lookfor the Houseboat Hirers Association logo if you're unsure. <p>Take a book on Australian birds, a pair of binoculars, comfortable clothes,some insect repellent and some 15+ sunscreen lotion. A shrimp-net and acouple of hand-lines will entertain the kids for hours. Make sure thepeople you go with are good friends. As large and comfortable as ourhouseboat was, it would have been hell-on-water with the wrong people. Wewere lucky.<p>And yes, we went upstream from Renmark but there are many, many otherbeautiful stretches of the Murray River to explore. It's 2,820 kilometreslong. Enjoy.<br clear=all><p><CENTER><hr noshade><A HREF="../holidays/index.html"        onMouseOver="waxon('holidays');        statuson('holidays'); return true;"        onMouseOut="statusoff(); waxoff('holidays');        return true;"><IMG name=holidays SRC="../buttons/butt_holidays_off.gif" ALT="holidays" WIDTH="140" HEIGHT="32" BORDER="0"></a><A HREF="../home/index.html"        onMouseOver="waxon('home');        statuson('home'); return true;"        onMouseOut="statusoff(); waxoff('home');        return true;"><IMG name=home SRC="../buttons/butt_home_off.gif" ALT="home" WIDTH="140" HEIGHT="32" BORDER="0"></a><hr noshade></CENTER><p><A HREF="http://www.electric.on.net">http://www.electric.on.net</A><p>&copy; This work is subject to copyright.
