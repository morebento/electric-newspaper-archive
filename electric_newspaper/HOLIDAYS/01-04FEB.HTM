It was more than acountry of  temples, the Pat Pong Road, a line of Australians on death row,and delicious aromatic food.  "Trust me," I was told, "there are only a fewsimple rules to remember in Thailand."<p>	 I have summarised them for other travellers:<p><IMG SRC="images/Thailand_1.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="250" HEIGHT="165" BORDER="0">	<B>1.</B> Remember that Thailand has never been colonised by a foreign power. Thepeople are very proud of their culture and religion. Don't point your feetat anyone, particularly while carelessly crossing your legs. That is aninsult. Treat the head as sacred, it is closest to the God or Buddha, sonever pat a child on the head.<p>	<B> 2.</B> Don't insult the King, Queen or the Buddha. They are venerated by theThai people. Coming from a country where dinner parties die unlessreligion, Charles and Camilla, and our freedom from imperialist apronstrings are chewed over, I wondered what people chatted about. We soonfound out they liked gossip as much as everyon -  just look at the featuresin the Thai English-language newspapers.<p>	<B>3.</B> Don't get angry. Defuse a situation by smiling. If you show anger youhave lost face and are embarrassed.<p>	<B>4.</B> Use your spoon to eat. Push the food onto it with your fork. Eatingwith the fork itself is akin to us putting a knife in our mouths. Leavesome food on your plate. Try to eat a little rice first, to show  respectfor what is the staple of life in Thailand. <p><IMG SRC="images/Thailand_4.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="250" HEIGHT="164" BORDER="0">	All this advice was intriguing. It explained something about a country ofdiversity and fascination . Thailand is a deep stream I from which I couldnot drink, but rather gazed into with  Australian eyes. Besides, you can'ttrust the water in Thailand. <p>	And so we found ourselves at The Oriental Hotel in Bangkok. In theAuthors' Lounge writers such as Somerset Maugham and Joseph Conrad pennedtheir experiences of Asia. (Maugham also used Raffles Hotel as a base.)They observed and wrote of life from their colonist perspectives - of thebright fish that dazzled and jumped above the surface, as quick as mercury.They knew of the darkness too, particularly Conrad, but it was frequentlyunfathomable and deeply mysterious. <p>	But this was a holiday of only  two weeks, so we too chased the colourfulphantasmagoric photos of our dreams. We saw chained monkeys in Koh Samuiperforming tricks for tourists and wondered,  where were the Abolitionists?We saw elephants playing soccer and picking up lines of beer bottles bytheir trunks when there are only  an estimated 500 wild elephants left inThailand. We saw a man who earned his living by having his photo takenwhile  being bitten by centipedes and with his face covered with scorpions.We saw destitution and poverty right next to opulent gold temples. <p><IMG SRC="images/Thailand_3.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="250" HEIGHT="164" BORDER="0">	We also saw heart-wrenchingly beautiful night skies stained with scarletand gold leaf,  experienced kindness towards (us) clumsy foreigners whocould not speak the language, we ate wonderful  seafood -  huge whiteprawns and small but delicately flavoured lobsters, and had a massage on amarble slab overlooking the beach.<p>	The quirkiness was probably what finally caught us in Thailand's magicalnet. The James Bond Island off  Phuket, where the Man with the Golden Gunwas filmed,  has developed a whole tourist industry. The rocks on KohSamui, carved by a bizarre act of nature to resemble male and femalegenitalia. This is a major tourist attraction and one which transcendscultures and shock-value. The bars on Koh Samui, where you can visit ashrine to Jim  Morrison at the Doors' Pub, worship the Blues at the BluesBrothers, or get into Reggae-man at the Reggae Bar. The way to thenightlife is via a rickety bridge  which gets worse as the night wears on.Not even the cockroach who took a liking to our nibbles dampenedproceedings. The Buddhist monk who died while praying is preserved in aglass case in a temple with his sensible spectacles still on is worth avisit and tourists are encouraged to take photos. We had no doubt where hissoul went.<p>	If you too are tempted to go, here are some final tips...<p><IMG SRC="images/Thailand_2.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="250" HEIGHT="164" BORDER="0">	<B>5.</B> Visit the island of Samui. The best way to get around the island is byrenting a small   motor-bike. Visit the three spectacular waterfalls. Stayat the Imperial Boathouse in Samui -  it is fabulous -  and eat at CharlieChaplins opposite the hotel. The staff own the motorbike shop so you cankill  two  birds with one stone, or one spoon. And a huge meal is onlyaround $5 each, though steer clear of wine - it is  very expensive.<p><B>6.</B> Bangkok is overpoweringly seductive: the silks, the restaurants, thebargains such as fake polo t-shirts for $5 and the beauty of the river.  Goon a river cruise and a one-day trip to Ayuthaya, Bangkok's ancient capitalis well worthwhile. There are examples of ancient ruins and temples likethe giant bronze statues of Wat Chiya Mongkoland Wat Panangcherng.<p><B>7.</B> Have a massage on a beach at sunset. It may or may not change your life.Thailand will let you leave but it won't easily let you go.<p>(Amanda visited Bangkok and the islands of Phuket and Koh Samui)<br clear=all><p><hr noshade><p><A HREF="http://www.electric.on.net">http://www.electric.on.net</A><p>&copy; This work is subject to copyright.
