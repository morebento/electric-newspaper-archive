Or had to exit a raucousand rollicking, swinging and swilling pub just as the first pint on Dimmskicks in? Well that's what it was like leaving dear sweet Ireland!<p>Yep, it may seem odd to start off travel-logging Eire by describing thefeeling of leaving it, but I truly confess desperately wanting to teetleoff into just one more pub, cakeshop, boozer, bakeshop or  whatever andhear that beautiful song of an Irish voice. The Irish are gems  - likeColin Hannagan who runs the Skerries Post Office B&B, whose greeting andwelcome was that of a long lost buddy who never writes to you but has neverchanged. <p>Colin, bless his soul, advised a small wander to the Black Raven Hotel fora lovely meal and a wonderful ale and, later in the evening, my mostpleasant discovery to date -a small cheek-full of the Leprechaun's orlittle green men's secret spirit "POITI'N" pronounced (here goes!) PUTCHEEN. <p>Well, no wonder this mob sing all right - this be the secret ingredient. Nosecret really; prior to the 1600's, one in two Irish households distilledtheir own. I'm not sure what the number is now but the recently-releasedlegal batch I was drinking under company name "Hackler" (said with agravelly voice like Rev. Paisley), is lovely. Try the clean spirit withfriends and you will sing alright, or as recommended by one Irish woman,"Rubbed on tired limbs and muscles does them a power of good". I kid younot, I prefer to do the inner-muscle work.<p>Now while discussing the great subject of travel and the odd tipple, I mustsay Ireland has the most extraordinary number of beautiful pubs. It's likelooking at the distribution map of the common housefly in Australia. Beinga froth-and-bubble, soil-grubble-cold one connoisseur, I noted in onetownâs main street over about 300 metres long that every third to fourthestablishment was a tavern pub, or free house. This is the honest truth.Now I've heard some oz-trepreurs have embarked upon the new craze of "themepubs" but I have to advise for the "Irish theme pub" you'll definitely need200 Irish men and women to go with it. There seems little point otherwise,and I met quite a few willing to fill the positions.<p>Back to the map, hire car loaded, trusty navigator and junior navigatorstrapped in, and off through Dublin City maze and medium-level chaostowards the west coast target of Fimerick on Motorway MII. Mind you, theM11 changes from motorway to minor motorway to country lane to main streetto small alley- way to motorway to whatever, to who cares-way! It's grand -the sun is shinning, the scenery is soothing and the stone walls whizz pastin endless noisy rhythm. Ireland is a soft green velvety gift-wrappedlandscape. No great excess in outlandish farm/town architecture - instead,subtle and simple dwellings, with stock appearing to inhabit the major partof the farm motels. Well, heads pivoting and tyres turning we eventuallycobble-stoned to Cahir Castle, a major dwelling of the Erectus Irish Species. <p>Cahir Castle apparently dates back to that time when we came down from thebranches and started to chisel away at the very land.  The castle is on arocky island in the river Suir, on the main road from Dublin to Cork. Thisis real old, real good, and for 13 year-old Viking son Jack, the first realexperience of buzz-blast, armour-clad, sword-slashing proportions. <p><CENTER><IMG SRC="01June/1Jun-02.JPG" WIDTH="146" HEIGHT="230" BORDER="0"><IMG SRC="01June/1Jun-03.JPG" WIDTH="178" HEIGHT="230" BORDER="0"><IMG SRC="01June/1Jun-04.JPG" WIDTH="100" HEIGHT="230" BORDER="0"></CENTER><p>This is home building on a serious level. Mind you, they had some peopleknocking at the door with very serious business, or actually wanting toknock the door down to discuss the business. But dealing with these mostlyunwelcome castle-to-castle salesman was easy. A feature of all (at thetime) modern castles was "the murdering hole". From the guide: "theoriginal entrance was from the South. This entrance is guarded by amurdering hole overhead, so arranged that a defender could drop a largeweight or some noxious substance substance on the head of any unwelcomeintruder."<p>Imagine your Hickinbotham Home with this feature, "I want you kids to keepaway from that murdering hole today. I havenât got an ounce of good hotcooking oil left!" or some clever oz-treprenur with the new-easy fit,Better Homes Murder Hole Kit. "Get rid of all those messy, unwanted andunpleasant household scraps, concrete hot ash, and obsolete white goods,install one now!" There's more - Cahir Castle offers the damp dungeonexperience, clambering through the tiny tunnels with armour-clad travel bagand battle reflex camera made me realise that at 187cm tall with a wellGuinness'ed waistline, I possibly would have been the large weight theywould have dropped down the murdering hole. The first line of defence onground level, or counter balance for the portcullis, these corridors weresmall! Wall thickness was more important than corridor width. You couldstill hear the clatter of armour along these tiny tunnels.<p>Our Irish jaunt or jig, though excruciatingly short, was pure delight. Itleft me convinced firstly that I would be happy to cancel my fondue nightwith the Pope for extended time in Ireland, and secondly even moreconvinced I would return, soon. Guinness,  I was told, does not travel welland should be consumed in hearty quantities in Ireland. Thatâs good enoughfor me.<p>Cheers,<br>George.<br clear=all><p><CENTER><hr noshade><A HREF="../holidays/index.html"        onMouseOver="waxon('holidays');        statuson('holidays'); return true;"        onMouseOut="statusoff(); waxoff('holidays');        return true;"><IMG name=holidays SRC="../buttons/butt_holidays_off.gif" ALT="holidays" WIDTH="140" HEIGHT="32" BORDER="0"></a><A HREF="../index.html"        onMouseOver="waxon('home');        statuson('home'); return true;"        onMouseOut="statusoff(); waxoff('home');        return true;"><IMG name=home SRC="../buttons/butt_home_off.gif" ALT="home" WIDTH="140" HEIGHT="32" BORDER="0"></a><hr noshade></CENTER><p><A HREF="http://www.electric.on.net">http://www.electric.on.net</A><p>&copy; This work is subject to copyright.
