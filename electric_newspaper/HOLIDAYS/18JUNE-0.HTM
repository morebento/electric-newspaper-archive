Many of these ads werethe size of the "Wanted to Buy" notices in our newspapers. Seven pagesfilled with delight.<p>Ah, the challenge of choice!<p>We felt as though they have the Festival of Arts happening every day.<p>We booked a couple of things before we left and left the others until ourarrival.<p>The first thing we saw was 'Oh What A Lovely War', performed by theNational Theatre in a big top.<p>This play has not been performed professionally for years, since thecopyright owner, Joan Littlewood, has refused any but amateur requests.<p>I understand her proviso this time with the National Theatre was that theplay could not be performed in a theatre - hence the circus tent. This wasnot however an alien environment to the Pierrot, music hall, black comedystyle of the piece.<p>I've come away saying that this was the best production out of the fiveseen during our time in London.<p>It is a lively, colourful and moving performance, which is presented by atroupe of actors/singer/dancers working as an ensemble.<p>The horrors of the First World War were graphically described in theperformance, leaving me chilled and convinced that these messages must berepeated.<p>I will never forget the Sergeant Major who had us all in stitches as heyelled at his troops in gibberish for an entire scene. Or the meeting ofBritish and German soldiers in No-man's Land at the front on Christmas Evewhere the nightmare of 'man's inhumanity to man' is transcended in a momentof simple cheer.<p>This production is currently touring England and is one not to miss.<p>Take a walk on the Bankside of the Thames and visit the new Globe Theatre.<p>We went to see Shakespeare's 'As You Like It' there, which is just the sortof thing you ought to do in London. Not only will you see a bit of theBard, but do so in a theatre, which has been lovingly created in the styleof theatres in Shakespeare's time. There are no nails, and no lighting. Wewent to the 4pm showing which was performed in natural light under the openroof of this circular theatre. Patrons can stand for 5 pounds or be seatedin boxes.<p>The great test of performing Shakespeare, I believe, is to ensure thateveryone effortlessly understands what is said. The current cast of 'As YouLike It' certainly managed this. I have been surprised to learn thatAnastasia Hille who played Rosalind has recently been chosen to perform ina wide range of other leading roles. For me, she was at times egotisticallyaware of playing to a large audience and her own personality rather thanRosalind's coloured her performance. She missed the depth of the role.Others in the cast were marvellous, particularly Paul Hilton as Orlando andJohn McEnery as Jaques who were at all times captivating to be with.<p>The 'I'll never forget' in this performance was the theatre itself. SamWanamaker's vision to build a truly Shakespearian theatre is an inspiringachievement and I'd certainly go back for more.<p>We saw the play 'Art' with Richard Giffiths (of 'Pie in he Sky' fame) atthe Wyndham Theatre.<p>The production magically created three separate living environments bychanging only the lighting on he stage. Oh, and of course one painting. <p>Three men make up the cast of friends with the script focussed on thedilemmas caused when one of them buys a painting for two thousand pounds.The canvas is totally white. Is this art? The script is tight and funny andvery popular among current actors. The cast is completely changed every fewmonths and I'm told they're lining up to have a role in this one.<p>The author, Yasmina Reza, won Best Comedy of the Year for the script andwhen she stood to receive the award shocked everyone by saying that she wasvery surprised to be receiving it because she had not written a comedy.<p>'Art' nevertheless is very funny and well worth seeing. Lots of othersthink so too, so you will need to book early for this one.<p>Richard Griffiths has great delivery skills and certainly carried off therole believably. At times I found it uncomfortable to watch such a largeman move around the stage. Will he really fit in that chair? Of course hecan, but as an audience member I found that his size limited his ease ofmovement for the part and was a distraction which drew me away from mysuspended disbelief.<p>Nevertheless I'd love to see another cast work with this script.<p>Go out and practice your reverse parking, take up a study of London'syellow pages rather than go to "Cleansed". This is definitely a no-go area.<p>The play is on at the Royal Court which has a policy of supporting newwriters. This can sometimes bring brilliance to light. I understand thatPeter Gill's 'Small Change' was discovered at the Royal Court.<p>'Cleansed' is best left alone. Whatever happened in the minds of the boardmembers when this passed as worthy of performance?<p>Does anyone really want to watch someone having their tongue cut out, thentheir hands and feet removed? Maybe there are times for these ideas to beshown in the theatre. Not when they are so badly done though and not whenthey are performed without any apparent meaning.<p>This play is incomprehensible. A doctor drugs his patients and gets off onremoving their body parts. In the final moments a penis is transplantedonto a woman who's bloody T-shirt is meant to indicate that the doctor hasremoved her breasts. Why these things happened and what meaning it has foranyone escaped us all.<p>I left this performance wondering why so much money was spent on the play.The stage was alive with moving parts throughout the piece and thetechnical costs must have set the Royal Court back more than a bit.<p>Well, save your money and don't go.<p>Three Pinter plays were on at the Donmar Theatre. The critics were ravingabout one: 'A Kind of Alaska' which turned out to be my least favoured ofthe three. Pinter himself is performing in 'The Collection' and there's nodoubt that this man knows how to 'do' Pinter. Both Douglas Hodge and LiaWilliams performed with ease. The plays themselves were somewhat dated.These are not the great Pinter scripts like 'The Homecoming', 'The BirthdayParty' or 'The Dumb Waiter' whose style can stand the test of time.Nevertheless the performance by those named made this a worthwhile evening.<p>So the smorgasbord is over for now. If you're heading off, do check out TheGlobe and track down 'Oh What A Lovely War' which the T-shirt says is beingperformed at locations all over England.<p><FONT SIZE="-1">* Brenda Kuhr is a theatre goer and critic, and collector of buttons, aswell as a semi-professional op. shop advisor.</FONT><br clear=all><p><CENTER><hr noshade><A HREF="../holidays/index.html"        onMouseOver="waxon('holidays');        statuson('holidays'); return true;"        onMouseOut="statusoff(); waxoff('holidays');        return true;"><IMG name=holidays SRC="../buttons/butt_holidays_off.gif" ALT="holidays" WIDTH="140" HEIGHT="32" BORDER="0"></a><A HREF="../index.html"        onMouseOver="waxon('home');        statuson('home'); return true;"        onMouseOut="statusoff(); waxoff('home');        return true;"><IMG name=home SRC="../buttons/butt_home_off.gif" ALT="home" WIDTH="140" HEIGHT="32" BORDER="0"></a><hr noshade></CENTER><p><A HREF="http://www.electric.on.net">http://www.electric.on.net</A><p>&copy; This work is subject to copyright.
