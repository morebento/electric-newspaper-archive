Or, so it seems to an unsuspectingtourist.<p>	Not merely content to charge what seem to be outrageous prices for almosteverything you purchase in this exhilarating, expensive city, theimpression is quickly formed that they're after every pound and penny thatyou've converted from your hard-earned Australian dollars.<p>	It begins very soon after your Qantas flight touches down at that ungodlyhour of 5 a.m.   At around $7 each to the heart of London, the undergroundbeckons! But beware !<p>	After the exhausting 22-hour flight from the peace and quiet of placidAdelaide,  it can be more than a little daunting to battle with  earlymorning commuters as you  defend your  bulging cases and bursting backpackswhile clutching warily onto your prized duty-free.<p>	An alternative might be a London cab. But that will put a dent of around$60 into your first day's budget.<p>	Worth considering is booking a mini cab before leaving Australia -- youwill still part with more than $40 for the journey. The current rate isUK/pound 18.50 and when you hand the driver a 20-pound note at the end ofthe journey you can be sure that he won't be able to find any change!<p>	With an air of reluctant inevitability, you relent. You sense the start ofa smirk on the cab driver's face, but he's long gone before you can protest.<p>	It's still only 7 a.m. The B & B you've booked yourself into doesn't wantto know you before midday, so after depositing your luggage in the foyerit's time for breakfast.<p>	But, being early on a Sunday morning, nothing's open except McDonalds.Prices seem almost as high in pounds are they are in Australia in dollars!<p>	Our budget for London was $250 a day for two. It cost us close to $350 andthat included staying at a B & B in Kensington ($116 a night), two nightsat the theatre and visiting  the usual tourist attractions. <p>	Some experiences, though,  are worth every penny.<p>	The hour or so you'll spend inside Buckingham Palace for $20 is a steal!The sumptuous splendour of Nash's architecture and decoration defiesdescription.<p>	At the other end of the scale, both aesthetically and fiscally, is atwo-hour journey up the Thames to delightful Richmond. You will travel on aboat that's seen better days and sit (if you'relucky enough to get a seat) on uncomfortably sagging plastic chairs.<p>	For the experience you will hand over $30.  <p>	And if you think that the somewhat inadequate commentary along the wayfrom the captain is an unexpected bonus, think again. He eventually passesaround the hat so that you can "show your appreciation in the usual way."<p>	Eating out in London can also cut a swathe through the averageAustralian's budget. A 3-course meal at Simpsons-on-the Strand (listed asmoderate) costs $65 a head plus wine!<p>	But, there are now cheaper Italian eateries everywhere. Nevertheless, thatbowl of pasta which might cost $7 in Adelaide is closer to $18 in London.<p>	Travelling is a thirsty business and a visit to Safeway or Tesco at thestart of each day for a large bottle of spring water is a worthwhileinvestment.  It makes it possible to avoid those ready to rip you off attourist attractions where even the smallest bottles of water can costanything up to $5!<p>	And in every snack bar, coffee shop or patisserie, the saucer sits on thecounter suggestively urging you to leave a bob or two.	But bargains do exist. Clothing is decidedly cheaper than at home,<p>chocolate bars also costless and Coca Cola from the supermarket is good value.<p>	But wearing a new outfit while munching a Mars bar and downing a coke isonly one fulfilling holiday experience.    <p>	There are two rip-offs (one of them, ironically Australian) that you cando something about...<p>	When your travel agent urges you to book your hire car before leavinghome, do it! A three-day rental of a small car (when booked in London) willset you back around $250 - substantially more if you want to drop if off ata different location from where you collect it!    	Pre-booked before youleave home will bring it down to around $140.<p>	One of the more insidious rip-offs involves theatre tickets. Going to thetheatre in London is a special and, often, inexpensive experience. Thehalf-price ticket booth in Leicester Square isparticularly worth locating.<p>	But the pre-booking of theatrical attractions from Australia can be a trap.<p>	A ticket for a premium seat at a blockbuster musical (the currentlyrunning Martin Guerre is a good example) costs $75 at the theatre boxoffice. Purchased via the Australian agent before leaving home, the verysame tickets are priced at $120.<p>	In these days of credit card bookings and cheap international phone calls,an astute Australian traveller can easily book by phone before leavinghome, saving as much as $90 on a pair of seats.    <p><hr noshade><p><A HREF="http://www.electric.on.net">http://www.electric.on.net</A><p>&copy; This work is subject to copyright.
