Auto-suggest - drive. Drive where?  Old Port Road,<br>15 minutes from the city. <p>Port Road was once planned to be the route for a canal; it  is now one ofAdelaide's widest roads. Century year-old palms and the tallest flagpole inSouth Australia loom large from water-guzzling green lawns on which no oneever sits or uses, dividing the dual carriageway and random blocks ofdeserted commercial conglomerates, pockets of abandoned narrow shopsspilling tears of rusted iron and shards of glass onto weedy footpaths.<p>End of the line, swing right into the Port. The antique cantilever bridgein the distance on the left. Backdrop of eyeblinkingly beautifularchitecture on both sides of the streets, not the sporadic remnants of theera we see in Adelaide city’s square mile.<p>We already know about the new restaurants, the maritime, historic militaryvehicles, railway museums, the Sunday markets sites, the theatre, nicegalleries. But not today.  Something beckons, indefinable, suggested by theexpanse of multi-textural sky and wharves and objects upon them.  There’s asuggestion of mystery here and who amongst us doesn’t enjoy a goodunravelling?<p>Drive on, a few minutes past the hub and its gentle hustle and bustle,straight through the next available gap in suddenly obvious and unfriendlycyclone wire fencing, right past the signs which say "No entrance tounauthorised personnel and vehicles". Aaaahhh , now this looks interesting. What would you imagine 26 metre highsilver metal objects closelyresembling giant dairy cans with yellow nylon webbing across their mouthsmight be used for?  <p>Crawling pace past a huge rust-brown barge, larger than any I ever sawgracing Amsterdam canals.  Flat bow that could be used for a doublehelicopter pad is laden with suburban accoutrement, toys, bicycles andlaundry happily flapping in clean brisk breeze.  A man steps outside.   Wewave and smile.<p>Attracted by the sight of a crow’s nest atop a small metal sailing ship,modelled on the Endeavour and moored on the opposite side of this littleinlet, we pass a lone fisherman whose dark Middle Eastern looks andsilhouette contrast amazingly against the brightness of the white ship,almost to suggest he’s been shadow painted in black on the hull.  Only hisslow movement belies the mirage.  Closer now, a sign is visible:"Half-share for sale".<p>Further along, a Dutch ship’s bowels offer up 12 metre long, 300 cm widered plastic plugged metal straws to a crane’s webbed talon.  Below, twodock workers, sporting impressive 50 centimetre wide biceps, deal with thepoles as they splatter noisily onto the wharf.  Then, deftly wiping asideweb and talon, they send them back down for the next haul.  One metre wideforklifts cart off their very precariously hitched wide loads to a moredistant dock where we will follow.<p>But not for long as there’s now an urgency to reach the next promontorywhere tantalising hills of twisted giant ropes, each one wider even thanthe navvies’ biceps, must, I think, represent a very large proportion ofhemp crops grown and processed long ago.  Now they look like the washed-upand dried out eviscera of some extinct sea monster.  The death of anyreally large animal holds at least a little fascination, if not amelancholic sense of loss of something far greater than we mere humans. <p>Perhaps spurred by this last thought, it’s now time to search forrefreshment.  When the red-headed, almost toothless attendant of thedrive-in bottle department of a lonely hotel hidden from anythingresembling a beaten track is asked what sort of sparkling burgundy might behad, the short answer is none.  "Thparkling burgundy?  We’ve only gotburgundy in a cathk!  Eh, Thid, ‘ave we got any cathkth of that burgundyleft?"  Enquire, "What about champagne?"  "We’ve only got two thort-th -Carrington Bluth and Theaview." Hold the champagne. No, well, after all,we’re only here for a short while.  Remember the eviscera!<p>A little later we’re back in a more inhabited area and, look! There’s awingless Canberra bomber in that yard over there!  My first visit to theHistorical Aviation Museum.  Here you might be fortunate enough to meet areally good, blue-and sharp-eyed white-haired bloke, part of the dedicatedvolunteer group who keep the place going with uncountable hours on missionsof air wreckage retrieval, restoration, display, museum attendance and soon.  This man is a gem of helpfulness, full of stories and knowledge of hisfirst passion, aircraft.  Here you can actually board a troop of its time;marvel at and calculate with awe how many mini-bombs there are inside amean looking cluster bomb; wonder at the destructive power of black,incredibly thin 3 metre tall rockets and generally have an awesome time.<p>But these are distractions.  Avanti!  Onwards!  Back to meandering throughthe far side.  Didn’t really come for structured, especially military,activity although it was pleasant enough.<p>After several more minutes of peering at the vast lanes of dull greycorrugated iron warehouse walls, I remember now that, many years before, Itravelled away from even less developed tourist trails to find examples ofonce elegant, intriguing buildings. Vandalised, burnt out and otherwisegutted remains left no hint or glory of their former purposes.  Some,however, contained twisted pieces of metal, rubble and corroded antiquemachinery suggesting heavy manufacture.<p>Well, blow me down!  Here, right in front of me now is one of the very bestof them!  Not too badly burned and still sturdy of mortar, brick andbluestone.  On closer inspection, old masonry, rubble and gnarled metalhave vanished, new pale flooring divides the lower and upper stories, shinynew roofing appears.  Approval of the retention of the slim cast metalart-nouveau columns now assist to support the floors. Suddenly, on cue, theworkmen arrive to answer my question before I had even asked them (how didthey do that?)  Yes, new owners were renovating to live here themselves,amongst an expanse of two- and three-storey iron warehouses set in fencedoff bitumen, strewn amid acres of weed covered stony soil.  Nice quietneighbourhood  for the most part.<p>Now I am satisfied with hope for the regeneration of one of the mostfascinating of our earliest settled areas. Without the strangulation of mycurrent mortgage, I could be easily tempted to buy into this and be one ofthe first of a new generation of Old Port settlers. <p>In the span of a few kilometres and a couple of hours of fossicking in thealmost deserted back blocks of the Port River wharves, it’s quite possibleto stumble upon more provocative images than one could experience in anormal week of furious activity in the city of Adelaide, Festival timesexcluded of course.<p>In anticipation, I apologise to the ‘wharfies’ for any incorrectestimations of biceps, poles and canisters.<p>Next time, I’m going to leave the city earlier so I can have a cup of teawith them at the stevadore’s deli on the wharf, if they’ll let me.<p><CENTER><hr noshade><A HREF="../holidays/index.html"        onMouseOver="waxon('holidays');        statuson('holidays'); return true;"        onMouseOut="statusoff(); waxoff('holidays');        return true;"><IMG name=holidays SRC="../buttons/butt_holidays_off.gif" ALT="holidays" WIDTH="140" HEIGHT="32" BORDER="0"></a><A HREF="../home/index.html"        onMouseOver="waxon('home');        statuson('home'); return true;"        onMouseOut="statusoff(); waxoff('home');        return true;"><IMG name=home SRC="../buttons/butt_home_off.gif" ALT="home" WIDTH="140" HEIGHT="32" BORDER="0"></a><hr noshade></CENTER><p><A HREF="http://www.electric.on.net">http://www.electric.on.net</A><p>&copy; This work is subject to copyright.
