Still, noone has ever accused me of having overmuch tact... or common sense, forthat matter. I should have guessed, when I saw the muscles in his handstand out as I made my first statement, but no...'I've just finishedreading a book called "Death of a Dentist"' quoth I brightly. His facedarkened markedly as his grip on the stainless steel probe becamenoticeably tighter. I was then treated to a short lecture on how there istoo much written and broadcast about violence in our society. Nothingdeterred, I went on (somewhat maliciously I must admit) 'The murdererdrilled holes in all of the dentist's teeth.' It does not pay to try to befunny at one's dentist's expense. 'Ow! That hurt!'. 'That's because as youget old the gums shrink and the roots become exposed. That's what happenedthen.' Touché.<p>M.C. Beaton is one of the pseudonyms of Marion Chesney who also writesunder the names of Ann Fairfax, Jennie Tremaine, Charlotte Ward and HelenCrampton. Where do these ultra-prolific authors find first, theirinspiration and second, their time to write? Not to mention theirnoms-de-plume. Her mystery writing pseudonym is Beaton and under the othernoms-de-plume she writes historical romances. The only bio I have been ableto discover says that she was born in Scotland and lives with her husbandin the Cotswolds: not very informative.<p>Enthused by what she has written as Beaton I did once order two of herromances. One arrived, and I found it insipid ... but then, I am not aromance afficionado ...and the other never arrived. I am, however, anardent fan of Hamish Macbeth.<p>If one is a TV watcher and has seen the televised Hamish, as played byRobert Carlyle, and his Lochdubh, it is necessary to forget about him whenreading the novelised exploits. There is very little similarity between thetwo characters. I like them both, although my preference is for the Hamishof the books.<p>I can never understand why TV producers have to change characters asradically as they do from those appearing in books. Even Hamish's dog,Towser (the late lamented) is, in the TV series, known as Jock. Why? Justto make him sound more Scottish? None of the other characters intelevision's Lochdubh share names, or personalities, with those  peoplingBeaton's books.<p>Indolent, unambitious Hamish is smitten with a toothache and has to seekout the  dentist Frederick Gilchrist who practises in the neighbouringsmall town of Braikie. To Hamish's dismay, he discovers the dentist isunable to help since he no longer has sufficient life to be of much use toanyone, to the delight of many people.<p>Macbeth is always excluded from the official investigations conducted byhis superiors at Strathbane because he turned down promotion. He does havea perfect record at solving mysteries, and invariably has to practisesubterfuge in order to uncover murderers since he has no authorised accessto official records. In earlier books he is able to further hisinvestigations by talking things over with his sometime girl-friend, laterfiancee and now former fiancee, Priscilla Halburton-Smythe. In 'Death of aDentist' Priscilla's place is taken by her computer hacking southern friendSarah.<p>Parallel to the murder investigation is Hamish's attempt to discover whorobbed a local pub of two hundred and fifty thousand pounds, in cash. Thiswas to be the prize at a Bingo night and mysteriously disappeared from thehotel safe (unsafe?) ... which had a wooden back.<p>There are the usual assortment of odd characters in this book as manypeople seem to be anxious to end Hamish's life. I think Ms. Chesney musthave been watching television's Hamish since in this novel, unlike most ofthe previous, Hamish manages to bed a beautiful girl.<p>'Agatha Raisin and the Terrible Tourist'  shares a place in the humorousmysterygenre with Hamish Macbeth.<p>Agatha's character is totally different from Hamish's. She is abrasivewhere he is charming. She blunders, he is frequently sly in hisinvestigations.<p>Agatha Raisin is a middle aged woman who sold her public relations firm inthe first novel of the Agatha Raisin series. She moved to the Cotswolds tolive and fell in love and decided to marry her neighbour, James Lacey. Inthe novel before 'Terrible Tourist', Agatha and James are about to marrywhen, horror of horrors, Agatha's husband Jimmy Raisin (whom Agatha hadthought was dead) turns up. And is murdered. Agatha and James solve themystery but when Agatha is hospitalised, James callously departs for Cypruswhere they were to have spent their honeymoon.<p>Agatha, who has been shown in the previous books of the series, to be verydetermined, goes after him. She admits she is obsessed with him and doesattempt, semi-successfully, to end the obsession. During her search sheencounters two parties of Brits each comprising a couple and an elderlyfriend, one party being upper class and the other determinedly workingclass. After Agatha finds James, to Agatha's disgust they find themselvesat dinner in the company of the two parties who have mysteriously cometogether despite an apparently mutual dislike.<p> Rose, the coarse, sexy but seemingly highly educated, woman of the workingclass group is murdered, stabbed while dancing.<p>James seems to Agatha to be overly interested in Olivia, the woman of theupper class party. In an attempt at payback, Agatha makes a date with aJewish businessman ... only to  find out that the widower was not currentlyso when his extremely youthful wife appears. Subsequent to that, Agathasleeps with Sir Charles Fraith, a character from an earlier novel..<p>Charles is rather malicious, and attempts successfully to estrange Jamesand Agatha.<p>Instead of having James as a companion in detection, Agatha must make dowith Charles. Of course, she succeeds and as usual has her own lifethreatened before  unmasking the killer .... surprisingly (to her)receiving no thanks from the police.<p>Beaton has two more Hamish and Agatha books coming out in hardcover. I haveno idea of the status of her romance writing. I do take issue with herwork, though. She employs rather a sneaky technique, I feel, by making herbooks very short (Terrible Tourist is less than 200 pages). Beaton alsoleaves more loose ends than I think are necessary for being a hook for thenext book of the series. I don't know if I am being unkind by whisperingthe word 'pot-boiler' behind the author's back. I am possibly overlycensorious in feeling a little more effort could have been employed inwriting this episode of Agatha Raisin. Despite these criticisms, I dointend buying the next in the series... but not until it comes out inpaperback.<br clear=all><p><CENTER><hr noshade><A HREF="../index.html"        onMouseOver="waxon('home');        statuson('home'); return true;"        onMouseOut="statusoff(); waxoff('home');        return true;"><IMG name=home SRC="../buttons/butt_home_off.gif" ALT="home" WIDTH="140" HEIGHT="32" BORDER="0"></a><A HREF="index.html"        onMouseOver="waxon('books');        statuson('books'); return true;"        onMouseOut="statusoff(); waxoff('books');        return true;"><IMG name=books SRC="../buttons/butt_books_off.gif" ALT="books" WIDTH="140" HEIGHT="32" BORDER="0"></a><hr noshade></CENTER><p><A HREF="http://www.electric.on.net">http://www.electric.on.net</A><p>&copy; This work is subject to copyright.
