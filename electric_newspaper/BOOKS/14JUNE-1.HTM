Puffin (this edition of the three stories published 1996)<br>rrp $US3.99</b><br><font size=-1>reviewed by Denise Wels</font><p>Diana Wynne Jones writes ostensibly for children, from the very young (towhom this book is directed) to the young adult spectrum. The author alwayswrites about magic and frequently about time travel. This anthologyfeatures only magic.<p>The three stories in this volume are 'Chair Person', 'The Four Grannies' and'Who Got Rid of Angus Flint?'.<p>After looking for the last-mentioned story for years I was bitterlydisappointed to discover, when I conveyed the gladsome tidings, that myson, who was the original object of my intended largesse, was no longerinterested in having me sit by his bedside to read it to him! 'Sharper thana serpent's tooth 'tis to have an ungrateful child' Just because he isgoing on 21... Oh well, I read (and enjoyed) it myself.<p>Wynne Jones has an accurate eye for adult foibles and recognises andemploys the honesty peculiar to children in writing about them.<p>In 'Chair Person', Auntie Christa is the typically organising woman whoalways manages to get everyone else to do all the hard work while being toobusy with overseeing projects to do any of the donkey labour herself. Sheis perpetrating a children's party on behalf of the Caring Society and hasturned up at the home of Marcia and Simon's family bearing a box of brokentoys she has obtained from Mr. Pennyfeather's secondhand shop, anddemanding the cooperation of the family in helping with the party the nextSaturday afternoon.<p>Auntie Christa dumps the box of toys, one of which is a Conjuror's Setcontaining a leaky Crystal Ball, on an ugly old armchair which the familyhad decided to throw out so they could buy a new one. The family manages tomanoeuvre the old armchair into their shed so they will have room in thehouse for the new chair but....The next morning they hear thumps comingfrom the shed and discover the armchair is now a person... an ugly andunpleasant person, but a person nonetheless. The rest of the story isdevoted to the family's attempts both to satisfy Auntie Christa and ridthemselves of garrulous and bossy Chair Person.<p>The next story is 'The Four Grannies'. Erg's Dad and Emily's mum havedivorced previous partners and married each other, thus giving the childrena set of four grannies.<p>The parents intend going away, but someone must be found to care for thetwo children during the parents' time away. Of course, as every parentknows, there is always a granny who would be very anxious to look afterchildren. In this instance, each granny is strangely reluctant so to do.<p>Just as it looks as though the children might be forced to look afterthemselves, first one, then all, of the grannies arrives, possibly as theresult of Erg's magic wishing machine.<p>Then Emily disappears, again, possibly as a result of the wishing machine.<p>Erg is horrified... he must take care of all the grannies, keeping them outof his way and out of trouble, while attempting to retrieve Emily fromwhatever limbo to which she has been banished by his ill-advised wishing.<p>At one point Erg displays the devastating honesty common to children bysaying innocently to the four squabbling grannies that he never realisedbefore how much they hated one another ... which provokes false smarminessand a temporary truce amongst his elders.<p>The final story in the collection is 'Who Got Rid of Angus Flint'.<p>Angus Flint at the sort-of invitation of Candida's father, comes to visitthat family after his wife leaves him (and no wonder).<p>How many of us have had to entertain unwanted guests who decide to come tovisit and take over the domination of the hosuehold, never wanting toleave? (I have!) Angus Flint is such a visitor. Candida's older sister isaway on a vacation of her own, thus Angus is able to take over her bedwhile making himself thoroughly unpopular with the remaining three childrenand their parents. How to be rid of him?<p>In this story, too, Wynne Jones has made use of animated furniture to bringabout her happy ending.<p>I would thoroughly recommend this book as well as Diana Wynne Jones' talesfor older children, to all wanting to read enjoyable books to theirchildren.<br clear=all><p><CENTER><hr noshade><A HREF="../index.html"        onMouseOver="waxon('home');        statuson('home'); return true;"        onMouseOut="statusoff(); waxoff('home');        return true;"><IMG name=home SRC="../buttons/butt_home_off.gif" ALT="home" WIDTH="140" HEIGHT="32" BORDER="0"></a><A HREF="index.html"        onMouseOver="waxon('books');        statuson('books'); return true;"        onMouseOut="statusoff(); waxoff('books');        return true;"><IMG name=books SRC="../buttons/butt_books_off.gif" ALT="books" WIDTH="140" HEIGHT="32" BORDER="0"></a><hr noshade></CENTER><p><A HREF="http://www.electric.on.net">http://www.electric.on.net</A><p>&copy; This work is subject to copyright.
