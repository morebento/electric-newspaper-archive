She now works at a university near Venice,although she has taught in Switzerland, China, Saudi Arabia and Iran. Thusproclaimeth the all too brief potted bio in most of her books. I wish theytold us more about her.<p>Leon has a wonderful feel both for Venice and for humanity. From her novelsabout Venice (and 'The Death of Faith' and 'A Noble Radiance' are the sixthand seventh respectively) I think I could by now find my way around thecity. She makes no attempt to disguise the corruption apparently rampantthroughout Venice but, by the sanme token, does not sensationalise it. Sheseems to say 'This is how things are. Accept it or not, its all the same tome.'<p>Commisario Guido Brunetti, Leon's protagonist, is a uxorious (herdescription) family man: the action of the mysteries is always seen againstthe background of his family life in which one can usually find areflection of the problems encountered in the central action. In the serieswe come to meet Brunetti's wife Paola who, like the author instructs at aVenetian university, and the Brunetti children Raffi and his younger sisterChiara. Unlike the children in other series who remain fixed in agethroughout, the Brunetti children are portrayed with problems  peculiar totheir increasing ages and these usually have a bearing on Brunetti'sinvestigations.<p>In 'The Death of Faith' a young woman, Maria Testa, formerly SuorImmaculata, visits Brunetti in his office to remind him that she was thenun who looked after his elderly mother, now lost in madness, in a nursinghome. She tells him of deaths that she feels are suspicious, that occurredin another nursing home to which she was transferred. As an innocent,firmly believing that she had only to point out possible transgressions tothe erring hierarchy for them to be corrected, she was horrified to bepunished and subsequently escaped the boundaries of her church and laicisedherself. Brunetti finds himself doubting yet believing her, while veryconcerned about the wellfare of his dearly loved mother, especially when ashort time later Maria is knocked from her bicycle and gravely injured. Formost of the duration of the book she lies in Intensive Care, guarded byBrunetti's men in direct contravention of orders given by Brunetti'scorrupt superior Vice Questore Patta and his henchman Lieutenant Scapa.<p>The death of faith of the title could refer to that of Maria or of Brunettihimself. For that matter, an abusive priest,central to the plot, whomolests girls in Chiara's class. seriously damages that girl's faith:Brunetti's wife Paole, does not respect the trappings of the church and sopresents a foil for Brunetti's own faith and doubts.<p>In 'A Noble Radiance', Brunetti, whose wife is, in fact, a member of thenobility, is warned by his father-in-law Count Orazio, that Paola isunhappy and that he, Brunetti, should see about finding the cause andremedying it.<p>A badly decomposed body is discovered buried in a shallow grave in thecountry and, because of a ring found in the grave,the body is identified asthe kidnapped twenty year old son of a wealthy noble family involved in theinternational transport of goods . The cousin of the murdered boy who hadbeen brought up, after his parents died, as a second son to the family, isnow the heir.<p>Again, Brunetti has to battle against Patta's machinations andinefficiencies in order to solve the intricacies of the puzzle. Patta'swish to fawn on the nobility, for whom Brunetti has scant respect unless itis earned, provides large obstacles to a successful investigation.<p>Mention of the talented Signorina Elettra, Patta's secretary, who abides byher own code of morals and ethics, should not be omitted in a review ofLeon's books as she is a pivotal character. Elettra is totally at home withcomputers and, having worked for a large bank but quitting its employbecause of its dubious ethics, she is able to probe the mysteries of mostgovernment and industrial systems via her modem, telling Brunetti that hewould really rather not know if what she does is within the bounds oflegality.<p>Leon's work should not be condemned to languish within the genre of mysteryfiction, but should gain wider recognition in mainstream literature asstudies of humanity. The last sentence of 'A Noble Radiance' gives more ofan insight into the character of Guido Brunetti than a page of descriptivewords could do.<br clear=all><p><CENTER><hr noshade><A HREF="../index.html"        onMouseOver="waxon('home');        statuson('home'); return true;"        onMouseOut="statusoff(); waxoff('home');        return true;"><IMG name=home SRC="../buttons/butt_home_off.gif" ALT="home" WIDTH="140" HEIGHT="32" BORDER="0"></a><A HREF="index.html"        onMouseOver="waxon('books');        statuson('books'); return true;"        onMouseOut="statusoff(); waxoff('books');        return true;"><IMG name=books SRC="../buttons/butt_books_off.gif" ALT="books" WIDTH="140" HEIGHT="32" BORDER="0"></a><hr noshade></CENTER><p><A HREF="http://www.electric.on.net">http://www.electric.on.net</A><p>&copy; This work is subject to copyright.
