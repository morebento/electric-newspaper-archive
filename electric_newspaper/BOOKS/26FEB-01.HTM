Hardly an openingline that stands on ceremony, but then with with JFK's constitutional andfamilial heirs describing one another respectively as "...an animal in manyways"  and a "“grandstanding little runt", this was hardly a relationshipof great finesse. It is also the point of departure and conclusion of JeffShesol's book, Mutual Contempt: Lyndon Johnson, Robert Kennedy and the feudthat defined a decade. <p>	Defining a decade is a towering claim for a book, but so were the figuresand the times. There's no argument about how Robert Kennedy and LyndonJohnson bestrode the American political stage post JFK. But was theirs thedefining relationship...hmm? And would you want to write a 500 page bookabout it? And would other people want to read it? Well I would. But if weare declaring interests, I have long loved the Kennedys, especially thatJack. Each ‘new' Herschesque revelation about JFK's inability to remain inhis own pants for long makes me more fond of him and his times. After all,a leader who spends more time doing it to their staff, starlets and othervaguely sentient beings, has less time to do it to his or her country.Think of it as a healthy tonic for democracy. But this isn't about JFK, itsabout the two men who were, at once, the custodians and casualties of Camelot.<p>	Shesol sketches beautifully the magnitude of the events that contained andshaped the relationship between Robert Kennedy and Lyndon Johnson. Thesewere very different men. So many things separated the two: geography,background and temperament to name a few. Then there was the jockeying forthe Democratic nomination for President in the 1960 election. All of thesethings divided John Kennedy and Johnson too, but were not divisions assuch. Whereas the older Kennedy and Johnson had, after the bitterness oftheir contest in 1960, a cordial relationship, neither RFK or LBJ forgaveone another the slings and arrows of their first major political encounter.LBJ, the consummate backroom, backslapping politician was everything thecool and somewhat rigid Robert Kennedy detested. As a result, RFK had noappreciation of the ‘qualities' that made Johnson such a formidablelegislator. Johnson with vast insecurities to match his vast abilities,could not fathom anyone who wasn't pre-eminently a political creature.<p>	And then there was Dallas. We forget now, if we are old enough torememder, just how cataclclysmic an event John Kennedy's murder was. In theheightened anxieties of the Cold War, the assassination was arguably themost traumatic transtion of power were in American history. Neither RFK orLBJ had the style or disposition to make it any different. Here Shesol'spowers of description falter a little.<p>	He talks of Johnson working the phones in the days immediately afterDallas, but doesn't quite convey what a man possessed he was. Johnson'sdedication to the ‘dog and bone' in late November 1963 makes a '90's phonecompany's efforts to poach a competitor's business look lethargic.<p>	We know from dictaphone ta!pes, made on LBJ's orders, that the manbeseeched everyone from the janitor to the joint chiefs of staff with theline, "I need you more than he[JFK} did". And we know, from those tapes,how haunted Johnson was from the very outset of his Presidency by theirreconcilable aims of accepting the mantle, placating the family, andoutshining his predecessor.<p>	So what kept Johnson and Kennedy in one another's orbits for so long? Theusual suspects: ambition and expendiency. Revealing the heights, or depths,of those ambitions is one of the great strenghts of Shesol's book. Inpublic Johnson needed the support of the Kennedys, such was the raw tug ofaffection for John F. Kennedy. For RFK, paradoxically, he could notchallenge Johnson openly until just before his own death. There was alwaysthe fear of resurrecting the old charges of "ruthless Bobby". And believeit or not, RFK needed Johnson's presidential prestige for his politicalpurposes. I had no idear just how far Robert Kennedy rode on Johnson's coattails into the Senate in 1964.<p>	It is, however, the abysmal depths of Johnson's venality and paranoia thatis most arresting in Mutual Contempt. Johnson had won one of the greatestmandates in presidential history in the election of 1964. He passed all ofJohn Kennedy's stymied legislation - a testament of course to the martyredPresident, and also to LBJ's greater skills as a legislator. Then he hitCongress with a welter of more legislation, again unmatched in Americanhistory. But still Johnson could not escape his shadows of JFK, or theliving legacy RFK. Not even RFK's assassination changed LBJ's tendency tosmallness.<p>	"On the morning of June 6, within hours of Kennedy's death, within hoursof declaring Kennedy a noble and compassionate leader, a good and faithfulservant of the people, the president phoned Clark Clifford and demanded toknow whether Bobby had the right to be buried at Arlington. I was stunned,Clifford recalled. I was dumbfounded. The president's call marked one ofthe saddest experiences in my long friendship with Lyndon Johnson".<p>	There was an element of Texas hoedown gone haywire to Johnson in theclosing days of his Presidency. He though nothing of tying up thebureaucracy with byzantine requests to make sure this minor appointment, orthat minor piece of legislation wasn't a "Kinnidy Kinspiricy". LyndonJohnson just couldn't rise above himself to apply to RFK one of his ownpolitical maxims: (to be said with a Texan darwl): "It's better to have aman inside your tent pissin' out, than have him on the outside pissin' in".The Liberal Party of South Australia please take note.<p>	If Lyndon Johnson is one of the great tragic conundrums of morden U.S.history, then RFK emerges as one of the great unlikely ditherers. AnotherShesol strength is his revelation of the extent of Rob!ert Kennedy'sindecision over running for President in 1968. Not so much ruthless Bobby,as rudderless Bobby.<p>	Shesol's book is a portrait of looming figures, set against a titanicbackdrop of Dallas, Vietnam and the civil rights explosion. Both Bobby andLBJ changed policy and positions, often for the worse, simply out of desireto gazump the other.  America no doubt suffered because of their mutualcontempt: but the question is how much? Did the relationship between RFKand LBJ define the decade? I am not so sure it did. Certainly the rivalrydivided the Democrats, but the things that were to give rise to Reagan'sdemocrats of the 80s, ie. the defection of traditional southern Democrats,had a life beyond Kennedy and Johnson. Changing demographics, incomes andRonald Reagan himself tell us more about how that happened. It wascertainly a relationship that defined Lyndon Johnson's approach togovernment. Then again, Johnson was what he was with no help from Bobby:hardly a relationship in the proper sense. Bobby's distaste for Johnson maywell have driven him to the Senate and on the road to the Presidency, butlet's not forget it was a journey he didn't complete.<p>	Surely the great defining political relationship of the time was that ofJohn Kennedy and Richard Nixon. Christopher Matthews in his excellent book,Kennedy and Nixon: The rivalry that shaped post war America, persuasivelyargues just this point. This was the relationship that in a way helped easethe paranoid Nixon on to the road to Watergate.<p>	Oh dear, those naughty Kennedy brothers. Into everyone... and everything:a Kennedy for every paranoid occasion. Mutual Contempt is tempting stufffor those interested in contemporary U.S. and world history. Read it as astudy of two great characters of the 60s, but not as the Rosetta stone ofAmerica between Dallas 1963 and Los Angeles 1968.<p><hr noshade><p><A HREF="http://www.electric.on.net">http://www.electric.on.net</A><p>&copy; This work is subject to copyright.
