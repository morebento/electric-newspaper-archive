Her previous novels were romance which explains mynot having encountered them. She says that her first story was apornographic fairy tale. Since I don't imagine it was published, I shallalways be forced to wonder....<p>>From Evanovich's writing style I would have estimated her age to be earlytwenties, but again I was surprised. She has a daughter aged in her earlytwenties, bits of whose character are grafted onto Stephanie Plum, the heroine of hermystery novels 'One for the Money', 'Two for the Dough', 'Three to getDeadly' and now 'Four to Score'. When a friend gave me the first ofEvanovich's mysteries instructing me to read it, immediately! I did soreluctantly. I am not at all fond of hardboiled mysteries and usually findthem tedious. After only a few pages I found myself laughing hystericallyand when I finished that novel I looked for more of Stephanie Plum. 'Fourto Score' is to be released this week.<p>The author does not strive for 'deep and meaningful' nor even  forconvincing characterisation. Like others of the mystery genre I have readrecently, she has an ongoing narrative from book to book. In this case,Stephanie Plum, a bounty hunter, is quite sure she does not want to getinvolved with policeman Joe Morelli who seduced her when she was six and hewas eight.<p>Half Hungarian, half Italian Stephanie was a ladies' underwear salespersonforced to seek alternative employment. She went to work for her cousin,sleazy Vinnie Plum, a bail bondsman, as a bounty hunter. Vinnie, in allEvanovich's mysteries, gives Stephanie unlikely assignments, then attemptsto double-cross her by giving the tasks to other bounty hunters as well.<p>Evanovich is good at creating unlikely characters... my favourite is herGrandma Mazur, an octogenarian good time girl out to take her excitements(and her men) wherever she can find them. She likes to carry ... and use...large guns and is responsible for hilarious adventures in at least two ofEvanovich's books.<p>In this novel, Vinnie assigns Stephanie the job of tracking down MaxineNowicki who failed to turn up for her court appearance after nicking herboyfriend's car. The boyfriend, Eddie Kuntz, offers Stephanie a furtherthousand dollars should she be able to find Maxine. Poverty strickenStephanie's  principles can be a little bent if a large enough sum isproferred, even though she wonders just what Eddie is so anxious toretrieve from Maxine... certainly not love letters, as he claims.<p>Vinnie, of course, follows his usual double dealing practices by assigningthe same duty to Stephanie's deadly enemy Joyce Barnhardt. Joyce had beenat school with Stephanie and had climaxed their long hateship by beingfound by Stephanie in an encounter of the closest kind with Stephanie'sformer husband.<p>As in all of the (award winning) Stephanie Plum mysteries, the job given toStephanie turns out to be linked to a far more complex crime beinginvestigated by her on-again off-again love Joseph Morelli. Along the way,Stephanie manages to leave a trail of disasters, usually involving firesand explosions, hindering Morelli and putting at risk the life of her pethamster Rex, who lives in a soup can in Stephanie's apartment.<p>The author has a wonderfully inventive mind when it comes to creatingstriking comedic characters. I thought she had outdone herself with GrandmaMazur in her previous books, but now she introduces Salvatore (Sally)Sweet, a drag queen musician nearly seven feet tall in his wig and pumps.Extremely hairy Sally, always in search of the perfect manicure, isstraight, which bothers his house mate, gay Sugar who is also part ofSally's rock group. A fight between Sugar and Sally leaves Sally bereft ofanyone to force him into his corset or put on his makeup.<p>Sally is a code expert and so teams up with Stephanie, the mysterious,effective and creepy bounty hunter, Ranger and Stephanie's friend from theoffice, massive Lula, a black ex-hooker (why are there so many prostitutesin the books I have been reading lately?), since Maxine keeps sending codedclues to her whereabouts to ex-boyfriend Kuntz.<p>Stephanie has a run-in with  local Mafia, encounters an unpleasant criminalwhose trademark is amputating fingers from his victims or, when asufficiently sharp knife is not available, scalping said victims. Yet noneof the victims is inclined to talk.<p>There is, of course, a hook for mysteries to come, in that Morelli'sGrandma Bella has a vision (she has 'the eye') involving Stephanie. Howwill Stephanie elude the foreseen fate? I don't really need a hook to haveme looking eagerly for book five involving Stephanie Plum.<br clear=all><p><CENTER><hr noshade><A HREF="../index.html"        onMouseOver="waxon('home');        statuson('home'); return true;"        onMouseOut="statusoff(); waxoff('home');        return true;"><IMG name=home SRC="../buttons/butt_home_off.gif" ALT="home" WIDTH="140" HEIGHT="32" BORDER="0"></a><A HREF="index.html"        onMouseOver="waxon('books');        statuson('books'); return true;"        onMouseOut="statusoff(); waxoff('books');        return true;"><IMG name=books SRC="../buttons/butt_books_off.gif" ALT="books" WIDTH="140" HEIGHT="32" BORDER="0"></a><hr noshade></CENTER><p><A HREF="http://www.electric.on.net">http://www.electric.on.net</A><p>&copy; This work is subject to copyright.
