She always has an assortment of eccentriccharacters and an almost believable plot which is never really tooobviously contrived. She is not averse to taking pot shots at variouspopular or semi-popular icons, either. In her book 'How to Murder the Manof Your Dreams' she took the mickey out of those impossible looking covermale models of the mass produced romantic market. I always feel that theonly reason they are casting adoring glances at the likewise apparentlyself obsessed heroines, as they strive to keep their best profile towardthe artist/photographer, is that there must be a mirror placedstrategically beyond the swooning woman, aping television's idiot boards.<p align=right><font size=-1><A HREF="02June-01.html">would you like to know more?</a></font><BR clear=all><p><hr noshade><p><font size=+2><b><A HREF="26May-01.html">The Death of Faith<br>pub Pan<br>rrp $15.95</b></font><br><font size=+2><b>A Noble Radiance<br>pub Heinemann<br>rrp $22.95<br>both by Donna Leon</a></b></font><br><font size=-1>reviewed by Denise Wels</font><p>Donna Leon is a Professor of English Literature .... though whether this isin the Australian sense of one with a Chair or the American sense of onewho teaches, I know not.
