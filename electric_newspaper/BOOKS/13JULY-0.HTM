Tessloses her job as a reporter and becomes a private investigator. <p>Lippman is intensely interested in social problems to be found in Baltimoreand has written stories, in her incarnation of journalist, on the terribleconditions and  inequalities she has encountered together with the povertyinspired crime and drug taking in the area.<p>'Butchers Hill' is based on a story the author had to cover. In real life,a man in his 60's accidentally killed a 13 year-old child who was in agroup which was harrassing him,  destroying both his peace of mind and hisproperty. He was jailed for five years. <p>'Butchers Hill' begins with two clients coming to see Tess in her newoffice. The first one, Luther Beale, identifies himself as the Butcher whokilled one 13 year-old boy in agang of five children living in a foster home, five years previously. Heserved the time in jail but now wishes to find the three boys and one girlremaining in order to give them, anonymously, the chance to improve theirlot in life... through scholarships or cars or anything needed to  extendtheir potential.<p>The second client identifies herself as Mary Browne, a black woman lookingfor her sister, Susan King, who was thrown out of home by their mother whenSusan became pregnant and wished to give up her daughter for adoption. Tesssuccessfully finds Susan, now known as Jackie Weir, who has become awealthy businesswoman and the investigation changes to become a search forJackie's daughter.<p>In her attempt to trace the four black young people, Tess has discovered that as a white woman she is severely limited in what she can find out. Blackpeople simply won't disclose anything to her. Jackie has discovered, in hersearch for her daughter, that despite her success in business, she isunable to deal with the white people she must interview in order to traceher daughter's whereabouts. Tess and Jackie therefore form an uneasy partnership, which graduallydeepens into friendship, in order to track down the witnesses as well asJackie's daughter, with Jackie questioning the previously reticentresidents of black Baltimore.<p>In the process of narrating the story, Lippman casts light on the terribleinequalities inherent in the adoption and foster parenting systems ofBaltimore as well as the dreadful rackets that can be run, disadvantagingboth the adopted and foster children as well as the relinquishing mothers,while giving unequal advantage to foster parents and sponsors. Telling thestory in fictional form gives far more impact to it than a simple (or notso simple) investigative story in the press.<p>Lippman provides humour in the delineation of Tess' relatives, but neverreduces them to caricatures. Tess is a Jewess who, because of her Catholicseeming name of Monaghan, is never recognised as such except by her ownfamily. She evenhas a severe anaphylactic reaction to crab and other shellfish which wouldprovide sufficient grounds for her maintaining a Kosher diet. Lippman, onthe other hand, is a Gentile with a Jewish name and so is constantly beingmistaken for a Jewess. As Lippman is at pains to point out in her novel,Jewishness is passed down through one's mother. In the bad old days of theJews being a subject race, constantly raped by conquerors, only theidentity of one's mother was certain, hence one's religion followed hersrather than that of an uncertain father. Lippman writes of what she knows,albeit in an inverted form.<p>'Butchers Hill' never flags. The events, based as they are on fact, neverseem unreal.  The plot, although convoluted, is not unrealisticallycontrived. The shock resolution leaves an unpleasant, although patheticallygenuine, taste in one's mouth.<p>'Butchers Hill' is added to my list of books to be re-read.<br clear=all><p><CENTER><hr noshade><A HREF="../index.html"        onMouseOver="waxon('home');        statuson('home'); return true;"        onMouseOut="statusoff(); waxoff('home');        return true;"><IMG name=home SRC="../buttons/butt_home_off.gif" ALT="home" WIDTH="140" HEIGHT="32" BORDER="0"></a><A HREF="index.html"        onMouseOver="waxon('books');        statuson('books'); return true;"        onMouseOut="statusoff(); waxoff('books');        return true;"><IMG name=books SRC="../buttons/butt_books_off.gif" ALT="books" WIDTH="140" HEIGHT="32" BORDER="0"></a><hr noshade></CENTER><p><A HREF="http://www.electric.on.net">http://www.electric.on.net</A><p>&copy; This work is subject to copyright.
