The main action is, like allGash's books, set in England.<p>John Grant is the real name of the prolific author who writes as JonathanGash, Jonathan Grant and Graham Gaunt. As a medical student, Mr Grant (Iuse the title advisedly... among his many impressive medical achievements,he is a surgeon) worked in the London street markets off the famedPortobello Road. He employs the knowledge thus gained in writing theLovejoy novels.<p>This book, unlike every other of Gash's books that I have read, is not aLovejoy novel. I was hoping he had given up on Lovejoy but note that he hasanother 'The Rich and the Profane' published. This is not to say that Ihave not enjoyed his Lovejoy books, but enough is enough! The plots of theindividual Lovejoys are very similar, each to each, but one can only readwith delight a limited number of Lovejoy's divvy, criminal and romanticexploits.<p>One could look on Lovejoy almost as a  precursor to Bonn, the chief maleprotagonist of 'Different Women Dancing'. Lovejoy makes a precariousliving, apart from his ill gotten gains in the antiques trade, from women.Bonn is a 'goer', a male prostitute, gigolo, cicisbeo who, early in thebook is promoted to 'key'... one who manages three other goers. I very muchappreciate Gash's glossary ... a definition of cant terms appears at thehead of every chapter.<p>Bonn and Doctor Clare Burtonall are both present at the death of a man whoalights, at the driver's suggestion, from a taxi driven by Oz. Salvo, whois associated with the network running both the goers and prostitutes aswell as many other commercial enterprises, manoeuvres so that the victim,Leonard Mostern, is run over, then backed over to ensure death, by Oz. Thisis all very convincing to onlookers who see it as a tragic accident due tothe victim's carelessness rather than the carefully planned murder that itis.<p>Bonn kneels by the victim's side and Clare comes up, announcing she is adoctor, to see if she can revive Mostern: impossible, of course.<p>Mostern's briefcase which is noticeably old and battered, is switched for anew one left at the scene of the 'accident' and later Clare is horrified tohear an intruder in her house then discover a briefcase identical toMostern's on her hall stand. She tries to dismiss the similarity as acoincidence... her husband, property developer Clifford claiming thebriefcase was delivered by a courier.<p>Clare tries to dismiss the mystery from her mind, but doubts... andfears... persist. Later she meets Bonn once again when he saves a childfrom an attack by a swan. She is intrigued by the fact that both police andsecurity guards all try to pretend Bonn does not exist until Bonn disclosesto her his profession.<p>Clare decides to investigate her husband and contacts Bonn through hisagency to ask him to perform the investigation. What he discovers dismaysher.<p>The book is fast paced indeed. The characters of Clare and Bonn are, atfirst glance, convincing. On reflection, I found doubts appear. Bonn isportrayed as coming from a very different background from that ofprostitution (even though an indication of his history is given early inthe book, I will not spoil the surprise of anyone who does not grasp thesolution immediately). It seems to me implausible that one coming from aninnocent background should fall so readily into a life of prostitution eventaking into account his lack of funds. How, for example, did he learn hisnecessary new skills?  The conversations that he has with his clients as hesoothes their nervousness I found very seductive, but the power he has toquell thugs seems less than possible. The bog mindles when one attempts tosonsider how his physical education would be acquired.<p>In Gash's Lovejoy books the author tosses lots of antique scams into theaction without slowing it. Here Gash injects quite a bit of medical talk,some of it a necessary part of the movement of the story: other, not. Ihave a feeling that some of it may, to a lay reader, hinder the narrativesince Gash does not attempt a complete translation of his professionallanguage. Sorry, Mr.Grant , unlike the antiques talk of the Lovejoy books,medical jargon is not as immediately translatable to the ordinary person.<p>Despite these quibbles ... and I would be the first one to admit that theyare probably only personal reactions... I found the novel absorbing. Theconclusion of the book is not final... Gash intends this as the first of aseries featuring Dr. Clare Burtonall, the second of which, 'Prey Dancing'is due out in October. I look forward to it and hope somehow to be able toread and review it immediately upon its release.<br clear=all><p><CENTER><hr noshade><A HREF="../index.html"        onMouseOver="waxon('home');        statuson('home'); return true;"        onMouseOut="statusoff(); waxoff('home');        return true;"><IMG name=home SRC="../buttons/butt_home_off.gif" ALT="home" WIDTH="140" HEIGHT="32" BORDER="0"></a><A HREF="index.html"        onMouseOver="waxon('books');        statuson('books'); return true;"        onMouseOut="statusoff(); waxoff('books');        return true;"><IMG name=books SRC="../buttons/butt_books_off.gif" ALT="books" WIDTH="140" HEIGHT="32" BORDER="0"></a><hr noshade></CENTER><p><A HREF="http://www.electric.on.net">http://www.electric.on.net</A><p>&copy; This work is subject to copyright.
