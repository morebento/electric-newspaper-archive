Toward the endof the books, when one would expect the resolution to be in sight, the plottakes off in one of those remarkable tangents reminiscent of Brownianmovement. It is as if, to take an example that has not (so far, at least)appeared in any of this author's works that I have read, the motives, meansand opportunities have been set out in the traditional way then all of asudden... BLAM lunacy strikes and we discover the true motive of themurderer is not to inherit Aunt Daisy's wealth or rid the world of someonewith a nasty habit of noisily sucking his teeth, but to spell out a rudeword with the first initial of the victims' names (is anyone old enough toremember the famous Bulletin poem of the sixties where a departing poet,subbing his own work, paid tribute to the Bulletin and editors in acompetent poem the first letter of each line spelling the real message ofthe oeuvre?)<p>The blurb on Kienzle's books describe him as a former parish priest. I, forone, would be very interested to read his account of leaving the priesthoodand marrying. Perhaps he has already written of this since he is a prolificauthor ... this one was number 15, and I have read (and given away) acouple since. Kienzle writes mysteries set in Detroit and his main protagonist is,naturally, a priest, Father Robert Koesler.<p>The back cover of 'Bishop as Pawn' apart from enquiring 'Who Bumped Off TheBishop?' describes Kienzle's book as fast paced. Certainly this particularnovel moves a little faster than others I have read which tended to becomemired in descriptions of what needed to be done for parishes in RomanCatholic Detroit, as well as difficulties encountered in practising ofCatholicism.<p>The corpse of this mystery is Bishop Ramon Diego, an exceptionally goodlooking Hispanic who clawed his way out of the barrio and carved a nichefor himself in the social elite, only to find himself appointed anauxiliary bishop back in an Hispanic area... not a prospect that pleasedhim, although his parishioners were overwhelmed with gratitude that theynow  had one of their own to look out for their interests. Diego kept avery large stash of money gleaned from his socialite friends on hispremises and bestowed largesse upon the needy populace.<p>Nonetheless, the bishop gained many enemies. Not least of these were twoparish priests, one of whom, Ernie Bell, has been threatened by Diego withclosure of his parish; the other priest, Don Carleson, is a formermissionary not long returned from Nicaragua where (we learn early on,although the police do not) he killed a man who had sanctioned the multiplerape of a barely pubescent girl. Two other possibilities for suspects are alawyer and his wife: the wife was involved in a sexless affair with thebishop... the husband complained he had been cuckolded by a pair ofpractising virgins... and the husband had physically threatened the bishopat a party. Then there are unnamed dangers from 'the street'.<p>Koesler's police contact, a black officer,Lieutenant Alonzo 'Zoo' Tully, isnot in charge of the investigation  but is subordinate to publicity seekingLieutenant Quirt who cooperates with an equally self promoting prosecutor,Brad Kleimer, who wishes to be in on the investigation so that Kleimer andQuirt may obtain lots of media exposure and personal glory.<p>The incredible content of the resolution of this mystery is not quite ascontrived or convoluted as in some of Kienzle's other books, for examplethe later 'Requiem for Moses', and given the character of Kienzle's heroesand anti-heroes in this story, could almost be believable.<p>Please, former Father Kienzle, in your no doubt many works to come, howabout some straight puzzling in preference to cryptic puzzles?<br clear=all><p><CENTER><hr noshade><A HREF="../index.html"        onMouseOver="waxon('home');        statuson('home'); return true;"        onMouseOut="statusoff(); waxoff('home');        return true;"><IMG name=home SRC="../buttons/butt_home_off.gif" ALT="home" WIDTH="140" HEIGHT="32" BORDER="0"></a><A HREF="index.html"        onMouseOver="waxon('books');        statuson('books'); return true;"        onMouseOut="statusoff(); waxoff('books');        return true;"><IMG name=books SRC="../buttons/butt_books_off.gif" ALT="books" WIDTH="140" HEIGHT="32" BORDER="0"></a><hr noshade></CENTER><p><A HREF="http://www.electric.on.net">http://www.electric.on.net</A><p>&copy; This work is subject to copyright.
