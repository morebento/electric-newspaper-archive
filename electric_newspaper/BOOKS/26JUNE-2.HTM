Presumably this is intended as a hook to maintain thereader's interest and stimulate him/her into buying the next book in theseries. The individual books are, however, stand alone.<p>I like McGown's writing: her characters are convincing and the incidents,although unpleasant (this book involves a serial rapist) do not dwellenthusiastically on the gore and ripped tissues. She does like to lay falsetrails but the red herrings are not overwhelmingly smelly, so that theacute reader may pick up the correct track.<p>The author employs a mystery tactic used by at least two other writers withwhose work I am familiar : Colin Dexter kept the given name of InspectorMorse secret until the latest of his books that I have read and GillianRoberts protagonist, Amanda Pepper, does not know the given name of herboyfriend. This last author is one I would dearly love to review. She ishumorous and witty and I hope she has a new book out soon.<p>McGown, alas, does not employ humour in her stories. Life and death arevery grim and earnest for her characters.<p>This book begins in the courtroom where Judy Hill is watching the trial ofa young man, Colin Drummond, whom she has helped catch. This man is accusedof being a serial rapist and has threatened that Hill  will be his nextvictim. Although he is found guilty and gaoled, he is out again withineighteen months.<p>Judy finds herself being targeted  by Drummond who phones her repeatedly onhis brand new mobile toy. She is not the only one receiving threateningcalls: all his previous victims, save the one who committed suicide, arenow finding themselves in renewed peril and one at least has severepsychological problems to overcome from the rape which she suffered.<p>The story line moves through the prostitution scene in the small towns ofStansfield and Malworth. A very young protitute, Ginny (perhaps MacGownDOES have a sense of humour since she thinks 'Virginia' an apt name for aprostitute) is probably the most engaging person in the story. She remindsme of  my computer in that one can not take liberties in instructing eitherGinny or the computer: each is a very literal being. The prostitute winsLloyd's heart in that he is fascinated by interviews with her as theyappeal to his sense of humour.<p>Against the main theme of the murderer/serial rapist runs the descriptionof the serial burglaries throughout the towns. I thought I was prettyclever in working out the method by which the robberies were carried out,early in my reading of the book. Nothing is straightforward, though, and Idiscovered I was not as smart as I had believed.<p>McGown skillfully plays with the way she draws her characters. Even thoughreaders of all her books know that Judy Hill is totally innocent ofcorruption and would never stoop to tricks to convict people, all of asudden the reader can find him/herself doubting  Hill's honesty. Could itbe possible that she was involved in corruption at the Malworth station?Will she be unfaithful to Lloyd and sleep with the defence lawyer whom sheinitially despises?<p>The author draws convincingly human characters. Lloyd is not the perfect,understanding, even tempered detective: he loses his temper and can be veryunpleasant and unreasonable to Judy in a way that has no real justificationsave that he is human and a jealous and concerned lover. He is not, as somany fictional detectives are, ruggedly handsome and physically perfect...he is quite bald and very short.<p>I shall continue buying Jill McGown's books even though I now know rathermore than I wished  about rape and prostitution in England. At least I amalways sure, when I buy one of her mysteries, that I will find it absorbingand convincingly realistic.<br clear=all><p><CENTER><hr noshade><A HREF="../index.html"        onMouseOver="waxon('home');        statuson('home'); return true;"        onMouseOut="statusoff(); waxoff('home');        return true;"><IMG name=home SRC="../buttons/butt_home_off.gif" ALT="home" WIDTH="140" HEIGHT="32" BORDER="0"></a><A HREF="index.html"        onMouseOver="waxon('books');        statuson('books'); return true;"        onMouseOut="statusoff(); waxoff('books');        return true;"><IMG name=books SRC="../buttons/butt_books_off.gif" ALT="books" WIDTH="140" HEIGHT="32" BORDER="0"></a><hr noshade></CENTER><p><A HREF="http://www.electric.on.net">http://www.electric.on.net</A><p>&copy; This work is subject to copyright.
