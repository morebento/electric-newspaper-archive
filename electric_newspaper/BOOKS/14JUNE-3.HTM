Warner, copyright 1996<br>rrp $11.95</b><p><font size=-1>reviewed by Denise Wels</font><p>Barbara Mertz = Barbara Michaels = Elizabeth Peters<p>Thanks to the amazing industry of the person who puts together all theinformation found on MysteryLadies site at<A HREF="http://www.geocities.com/Wellesley/3400/">http://www.geocities.com/Wellesley/3400/</A>I was able to discover that the above three authors were one and the same.<p>I have read nothing by Barbara Mertz (the lady's real name) and only twobooks by Barbara Michaels ('The Dancing Floor', pub Harper, rrp. $13.95,copyright 1997. and 'Witch' pub Berkley, rrp $US6.99 copyright 1973) I haveread some short stories in the name of Elizabeth Peters as well as a novelin paperback, 'The Hippopotamus Pool', pub. Warner, rrp  $11.95. copyright1996.<p>Barbara Mertz has a Ph.D. in Egyptology and as Elizabeth Peters drawsheavily on her knowledge, without becoming didactic. Take heart all youacademics attempting to enthuse your Ph.D. students with a passion forgetting on with their work: this woman was writing much fiction while atthe same time working at obtaining her Ph.D. in '86. It can be done!<p>In her Michaels' persona 'The Dancing Floor' is novel no.28: as ElizabethPeters, 'The Hippopotamus Pool' is no.25. I gather she writes learned tomesas Barbara Mertz. I think 'prolific' is a fair description of the lady.<p>Over the intervening 24 years between 'Witch' and 'Dancing Floor' Michaelshas refined her style. The first mentioned is heavily laced with thesupernatural  and a large dash of romance and horror while the second ismore subtle in its approach.<p>Despite 'Witch' being an obviously early and far less mature work than'Dancing Floor' it is nonetheless quite enjoyable if one is not looking foranything too heavy and thoughtful and does not object to dollops of romance.<p>Ellen, a thirty-eight year old divorcee with a teenage daughter has beenkeeping house for her widowed brother-in-law and his three sons for someyears. Now Ellen's daughter is going to Europe for a vacation thenreturning to attend college away from home. Jack, Ellen's brother-in-law,has accepted an overseas diplomatic posting and his three sons will all bein college so, faced with the breakup of the family, Ellen buys a house ina small village in the country.<p>Naturally the house is supposed to be haunted, by the spirit of a witchfrom the early eighteenth century and Ellen quickly acquires an unenviablereputation  with the local populace who we  note have no sense of humour,after making some fun predictions for the local youth, which come true.Coincidence, of course,  or is it? COULD Ellen be a witch?<p>Ellen, we learn at the beginning of the book, is in love with Jack but inthose days it was apparently politically incorrect to give one'sbrother-in-law any hint of non-sisterly affection. When Ellen meets herneighbour, eligible Norman McKay, the reader can easily sense romance is,somehow or other, afoot. There are several flies in the ointment one ofwhich is Norman's mentally disturbed nephew Tim. Another is that Norman isan ailurophobe, something that apparently acts as a great attraction toIshtar (the only reference to Ms. Michaels' Egyptological background),Ellen's cat; but Norman is possessed of two fierce dogs which terrify bothhis nephew and Ellen.<p>The village has the almost obligatory lecherous minister in charge of thewonderfully named Earthly Church of the Wrath of God. The minister,naturally, makes oblique advances to Ellen, who rebuffs him and alsoalienates Mrs. Grapow, the local shopkeeper and leader of the village'swomen.<p>What witch would be complete without a familiar? A white cat, reputedlybelonging to the  witch, Maria,who had set up an animal sanctuary aroundthe house, is seen near Ellen's house (perhaps Maria should have taken outa patent on something more effective than Geritol, to work that smallmiracle). Supernatural manifestations aplenty bedevil Ellen but she beginsto feel a strange rapport with the long dead witch. Whose is the femaleshadow that appears in Ellen's bedroom? Can it be (gasp) that of the deadenchantress? Come to think of it, aren't ghosts referred to as 'shades'?<p>Because I had read the (much) later book by Michaels, I enjoyed this onedespite its comparative lack of depth. I do intend reading some more of herintermediate work and look forward to reading her inevitable later work.<p>As Elizabeth Peters, Mertz presents us with totally different face.<p>'The Hippopotamus Pool' exhibits almost Wodehousean humour crossed with theSaturday matinee perils of Indiana Jones type adventurers.<p>The hippopotamus of the title is the Egyptian goddess, Taueret , thepatroness of childbirth.The Hippopotamus Pool is the title given by AmeliaPeabody Emerson to a papyrus fairy tale which she is translating.<p>The story is told in the first person by Amelia, wife of Radcliffe Emerson(known to his Egyptian workers as 'Rather of Curses' because of his easyemployment of swearing) and mother of enigmatic Walter Peabody Emerson,commonly known as Ramses and feared as a demon by the local population. Howa fifteen year old boy could acquire sufficient maturity to appearenigmatic defies my imagination, but then I doubt Peters sees hercharacters as other than caricatures.<p>Amelia (addressed by her husband as 'Peabody', her maiden name) andRadcliffe (addressed in return by Amelia as Emerson ... he loathes hisgiven name) are Egyptologists seeking a new tomb, reported to beundisturbed by grave robbers and with the mummy of Queen Tetisheri intact.A statue of Tetisheri bears an uncanny resemblance to Nefret, the teenageward of the Emersons. Amelia is told that Nefret is the reincarnation ofTetisheri.<p>Peters blithely mixes historical figures with her her fictional characters,allowing them a part in the action.<p>Peters carefully overdraws her character... Emerson is frequently portrayedas 'snapping' his teeth, this, presumably as an attractive aspect of hismasculinity. Amelia is heroically drawn, she as well as her son beingportrayed as intimidating the locals with her magical powers, not the leastof which are held in a special parasol which she uses to defend herselfwhen threatened physically. She and Emerson are deeply in love despite hisattraction for (not to) lovely ladies throughout the story.<p>The book begins with a strange masked man, Saleh, claiming to be thereincarnation of Heriamon the High Priest  of the ka of Tetisheri, seekingan interview with Emerson. He displays an ancient ring which he insists hasbeen handed down for thousands of years and that each of his incarnationshas borne the responsibility of ensuring Tetisheri's safe rebirth. Heexhorts the Emersons to excavate the tomb of Tetisheri and is about to givethem a map of its location when he falls into a fit, the lights go out,Amelia flees to find a doctor, and the body of Mr Saleh disappears. Saleh'scorpse is later discovered, but no word of a further incarnation is spoken.<p>There are mysterious and threatening figures appearing almost on everypage. Is Miss Marmaduke, the lady who offers her services both as assistantto the Egyptologists and instructor of the children a spy or a vapidfoolish woman? Is the child David, rescued from one of the antiquitiesforgers and grandson to Abdullah, the Emerson's foreman, the abusedalthough talented artistic child he appears or a spy for the aforesaiddealer?<p>Two cats, Anubis, who claims Emerson as his own, and a female, alwaysreferred to as'the cat Bastet' (at one stage Ramses exhorts her 'Comealong, the cat Bastet' ... and she does!) play important parts in theaction.<p>Peters introduces journalists, both good and bad, into the plot: the storyabounds with inimical as well as benevolent people ... but how can onedistinguish between the two? Implications of the supernatural abound butare never overt as they are with her Michaels pseudonym.<p>Ms. Mertz gives the reader the benefit of her vast expertise in Egyptologybut never lets the pace flag nor bog down in didacticism. She is both funnyand witty as she has (non-archaeological) digs  at standard heroes andvillains alike.<p>Had I not read in the MysteryLadies site, that font of information onmystery fiction, that Michaels and Peters were the one person, I wouldnever have been tempted to read books by both pseudonyms concurrently andthus would have missed an exjoyable experience.<br clear=all><p><CENTER><hr noshade><A HREF="../index.html"        onMouseOver="waxon('home');        statuson('home'); return true;"        onMouseOut="statusoff(); waxoff('home');        return true;"><IMG name=home SRC="../buttons/butt_home_off.gif" ALT="home" WIDTH="140" HEIGHT="32" BORDER="0"></a><A HREF="index.html"        onMouseOver="waxon('books');        statuson('books'); return true;"        onMouseOut="statusoff(); waxoff('books');        return true;"><IMG name=books SRC="../buttons/butt_books_off.gif" ALT="books" WIDTH="140" HEIGHT="32" BORDER="0"></a><hr noshade></CENTER><p><A HREF="http://www.electric.on.net">http://www.electric.on.net</A><p>&copy; This work is subject to copyright.
