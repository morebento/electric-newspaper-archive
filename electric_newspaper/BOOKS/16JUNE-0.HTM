At $35 it could be seen as expensive (and ofcourse, if the $A continues its downward crawl, it will become even morepricey).<p> At present Pratchett's work (and he will be visiting Australia,though, sadly, not Adelaide, next month) may be found in the sciencefiction section of your local bookstore. He is not (yet) in the Litrachasection. Still, I suppose Jonathan Swift would, in his day, have had'Gulliver's Travels' confined to the Fantasy section, if there was such agenre in those bygone times..<p>Until Pratchett wrote the first of his Discworld novels 'The Colour ofMagic' and 'The Light Fantastic' he was seen only as a children's writer.His first Discworld books poked only mild fun at the world: tourism andscience primarily.  Who can forget his iconograph, the Discworld equivalentof a camera, in which a little demon sits painting furiously until hecompletes a representation of the outside world? We first met Two Flowersthe Tourist's Luggage, later generously bequeathed to a terrifiedRincewind, in the first of the Discworld books. Just what the Luggage ( nowopalised and coyly known as 'Trunkie' in 'The Last Continent') is meant tosatirise I am not sure, unless Mr. Pratchett has ever observed my method ofpacking.<p>In the first few Discworld books there was no evidence at all of off-colourhumour: it was all Simon pure (who WAS this unlikely Simon?).As time hasprogressed a little colour has been observed to redden Simon's formerlyalabaster cheeks.<p>Discworld is. as evidenced by its name, a flat disc perched atop fourelephants which, in turn, stand at the edges of the shell of a giantturtle, the Great A'Tuin. The events taking place on the Discworld aresomehow distorted (ever so slightly) reflections of what occurs on ourtraditionally spherical world.<p>Since the inception of Discworld, Pratchett has mocked Hollywood, feminism,universities, the army, the police, religion (one of my favourites  is'Small Gods'), Death, fairies and (as they say) much,much more. Now it isthe turn of Australia, although there is a disclaimer from the publisherson the jacket of the book, announcing that 'Terry Pratchett would like itto be known that 'The Last Continent' is not a book about Australia. It'sjust vaguely australian' (sic).<p>Briefly, the Unseen University (home of the wizards who educate promisingstudents ... all male... in Magic) has a bigger problem than usual. ItsLibrarian has spent countless years in the form of an orang-utan (it wasthe leakage from the rampaging books of magic that transformed him fromhuman seeming). Now his morphic field as well as his temporal lobe, hasbeen damaged and every time he sneezes he is transformed into somethingelse. The faculty of UU realises something has to be done about thisdreadful state of affairs since, without their ultra-efficient Librarianwho knows what will happen to their Library and its vast store of esotericknowledge? One suggestion is that Rincewind, rogue and inept wizard (orWizzard, as his pointy hat proclaims) knows the Librarian's True Name,knowledge of which might be able to help effect a cure.<p>The faculty ... Archchancellor Ridcully, Dean, Senior Wrangler, Chair ofIndefinite Studies, Lecturer in Recent Runes, Ponder Stibbons (the youngestand most easily ignored, but most scientifically minded member of theFaculty) and the Bursar .... decide they must attempt to cure theLibrarian. Inadvertently they travel to a beach which is located tenthousand years in the past. Mrs. Witlow, the University's housekeeper,follows them to the sunny island , but moves the wood keeping ajar thewindow linking them to the present. The wood has been clearly labeled  'Donot remove this wood.Not even to see what happens. IMPORTANT!' Thus thewizards (together with Mrs. Witlow) are stranded in the past, and Pratchetthas a lovely time getting them to discuss some of the paradoxes indulged inby contemporary science fiction authors.<p>Rincewind, by a strange Discworld coincidence, is vaguely mislaid on theLast Continent of EcksEcksEcksEcks (Fourecks for short) where he isintroduced to many arcane mysteries. He discovers that the locals knownothing about rain ... indeed, it is seen as highly improbable and were itto exist it would be downright dangerous! Everyone knows that water comesfrom underground.<p>The inept 'wizzard' has been shown how to survive on local food....strangetwisted roots and crawly things that are found under rocks which, whencooked, taste exactly like chicken... by black people living on thecontinent. Then he is shown how to find the True Bush Tucker. He only hasto look under rocks and behind bushes to find, for example, chickensandwiches that taste like, of all things, chicken as well asunearthing...er, undiscworlding... a sponge delight coated with chocolateicing and dusted lightly with coconut flakes, as dessert. After all, he istold, he has to be kept fit and healthy for his quest to rescue the UnseenUniversity's most illustrious members from the past. Not quite the sort ofadventure on which Rincewind delights to embark. Rincewind never delightsin embarking on any kind of adventure. Therefore Rincewind runs!<p>Rincewind, throughout his sporadic and peripatetic existence on theDiscworld , has preserved his life (Death now only makes social visits tohim, speaking, as always, in small upper case) by running. Very fast. Heneeds to do this constantly throughout this book. During his many escapeshe becomes the swagman of 'Waltzing Matilda' fame, invents Vegemite, hidesin the Opera House (which reminds him of an open tissue box) is presentedwith a Pie Floater (Good Gods! Could Pratchett  possibly be poking fun atAdelaide's own Gourmet Delight?), is responsible for the first PeachNellie, encounters Discworld's equivalent of Priscilla Queen of the Desertand the Gay Mardigras (without realising that the magnificent large womenwith big feet and hands might not be female) and finally introduces rain tothe long drought-stricken Last Continent.<p>The Faculty, in their attempts first, to return to Ankh-Morpok, but whenthey realise they are trapped in the past, to regain the present, meettheir share of oddities. They encounter the god of Evolution, in whomPonder Stibbons takes an inordinate interest and with whom even considerstaking up an apprenticeship. And could it be that the  wizards arguing in ahighly charged magical field, are responsible for the creation of the duckbilled platypus?<p>Then the wizards are cast up on the shores of the Last Continent as it isin the process of being created and more chaos ensues.<p>Mention of Terry Pratchett's work would not be complete without a referenceto Josh Kirby's art. Kirby, in his delightfully manic depictions somehowmanages to encapsulate almost all the action of Pratchett's novels ... nomean feat considering the amount of that action... on the dust jackets farmore successfully than any written blurb. I wish I had some of his originalart-work to hang on my walls!<p>I have read American reviews of Pratchett's work which are disparaging inthe extreme. Well, Americans do have a DIFFERENT sense of humour, do theynot? For that matter, a True American would have to ridicule a book writtenwithout any chapters. For my part, and on behalf of his very many loyalAustralian fans, I can only urge Pratchett to continue his relating of theHistory of the Discworld. Lots of it.
