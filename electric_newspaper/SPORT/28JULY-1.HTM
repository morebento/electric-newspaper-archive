Mika Hakkinen (McLaren-Mercedes), 1hr30m 44.086s (202.777 km/h); 2. David Coulthard (McLaren-Mercedes), 5.3seconds behind; 3. Michael Schumacher (Ferrari), 39.1 seconds behind  <p>Q. Congratulations, Mika, on your impeccable race and a return to thetop of the podium which you've been waiting for since Monaco. How didyou manage to make it look so convincing? <p>MH: The team played a very important part in this race, especiallywith the tactics which we had worked out together. The strategy wechose was to make just one fuel stop, and that was definitely idealfor me. I was able to charge and go flat out all the time: noproblems for me today. <p>Q. You made a fantastic start. Was that expected? <p>MH: The start is always a bit of a gamble and at the end of the dayyou can never know how it is going to work out. This time I had JeanAlesi and Giancarlo Fisichella ahead of me, and because I had no ideahow well they would start, I just did the best I could possibly do --and it definitely worked. I simply kept my foot down, I got goodtraction from the Bridgestones and I overtook them both before thefirst corner. <p>Q. That was a great battle which you and Michael had for the first 14laps. Were you confident about being able to hold him off? <p>MH: Yes, although I had some problems with the brakes which meant Iwasn't able to go as hard into the corners as I would have liked togo at the beginning of the race. At that time Michael was almostcatching me, but then I managed to get the brakes balanced, and amore consistent balance in the tyres. So then I was able to charge,and the gap started to open out until Michael ran wide. After thatthe gap was definitely big. <p>Q. David, your last podium appearance was five races ago, in Spain.It doesn't require much imagination to know how you feel at thismoment ... <p>DC: It's even longer since Mika was last on the podium! It's great tobe back, especially given that I had such a bad qualifying positionyesterday. None of us would have expected me to be so far back on thegrid, but in conditions [like yesterday's] you have to be on the ball-- and I wasn't -- so I started a long way back. After the start andthe second corner accident [which damaged my car] I was very luckythat there was a Safety Car period, which allowed me to go into thepits to change the front wing and [get back into the race] at theback of the pack. When you have a car that is as good as my car is,it makes it quite easy to overtake. I want to compliment all thedrivers that I overtook today, because they were 100 per cent fairand absolutely committed in selecting the lines they wanted -- andsticking to them. This was a good, clean motor race. <p>Q. There was one moment, with about 25 laps to go, when you suddenlylost four or five seconds. You had already got through all thetraffic, and Eddie Irvine was catching you again. What happenedthere? <p>DC: After I had made my refuelling stop and taken the second settyres, the car wasn't working quite as well as it did before. But Iknew that Eddie was making two stops to my one, so I was playingaround with lap times to try to find the most consistent pace atwhich to run. It was when I tried to push a little bit again that Iran wide at Turn 6 and got on to the marbles. I preferred to let thecar run wide on to the grass rather than take any gamble by trying topull it back. That may have cost me a little time, but it was thesafest option in guaranteeing that I kept second place. <p>Q. Michael, third place must be quite a good result today --considering that you were virtually out of the race at one point. <p>MS: Yes, the way our car resisted that 'off,' it must be as tough asa truck, because I was quite high in the air. I certainly thought itwas greater damage [than it was]. There was enough damage anyway tohave to do one lap without the front wing on my way in, which cost mea lot of time. It was a stupid mistake by myself. I went off theline, and off the line there is so much dust that you have no chance,you just run wide. After that I had a great pitstop from the guys,they changed a wing, I went back into the race 16th and now I havefinished third. It was quite a nice challenge, especially when mysecond pitstop finished because then I was back behind various carswhich I had only just overtaken. I had to re-overtake them again. Inthat sense it was quite exciting. <p>Q. You seemed to catch up pretty quickly after changing your nosecone, but one person who caused you a certain amount of trouble wasyour brother Ralf ... <p>MS: Yes, he was obviously fast, and he is there to race, not to giveme any presents. He works for a different team, and he fought all theway to the end. He did it in a fair way. After the driver's briefingthere was an arrangement [between all the drivers] that we wouldchange line only once [when being overtaken]. Ralf did it perfectly,he only moved over once. I had the outside free, which wasn't thenice line. But at the next corner I had more acceleration and caughthim on the next straight. It was perfect. <p>Q. You caught and passed Eddie Irvine quite quickly at the end. Wasthat a team strategy? <p>MS: No, we had a brake problem. We were very marginal on brakes, bothof us. Eddie seemed to be a bit worse than me, and the team asked usto slow down. At one stage I was able to overtake Eddie then. <p>Q. Mika, you go to Hockenheim 8 points ahead of Michael. What willyour tactics be there? <p>MH: The race continues, basically. I'm sure there are going to besome more exciting races [between] now and the end of the season. I'mextremely positive about it. The team is working extremely hard. Theyhave already made great progress with the car, including the engine,and the tyre development goes on all the time with Bridgestone. SoI'm looking forward to going to Hockenheim.      <br clear=all><p><center><hr noshade><A HREF="http://www.electric.on.net"        onMouseOver="waxon('home');        statuson('home'); return true;"        onMouseOut="statusoff(); waxoff('home');        return true;"><IMG name=home SRC="../buttons/butt_home_off.gif" ALT="home" WIDTH="140" HEIGHT="32" BORDER="0"></a><A HREF="../sport/index.html"        onMouseOver="waxon('sport');        statuson('sport'); return true;"        onMouseOut="statusoff(); waxoff('sport');        return true;"><IMG name=sport SRC="../buttons/butt_sport_off.gif" ALT="sport" WIDTH="140" HEIGHT="32" BORDER="0"></a><hr noshade></center><p><A HREF="http://www.electric.on.net">http://www.electric.on.net</A><p>&copy; This work is subject to copyright.
