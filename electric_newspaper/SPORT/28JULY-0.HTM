Answer: cars go crunchinto each other and off in various directions.<p>Hoopla kicked off the start of the A1-Ring GP which ultimately settled downinto an exciting race with a lackluster processional finish.<p>At the end of the warm-up lap as the cars were slotting themselves intoposition on the grid Michael Schumacher waited a fraction too late to turninto his fourth spot trying to avoid as much dust as possible on the rightsideof the track. His car skewed in a diagonal position with front wheelsoverhanging the white front line. Schumacher signaled to the marshals,reversed the engine and straightened the car properly.<p>Olivier Panis stalled his car at the start and the car was quickly removedfrom the track.<p>The safety car was called out for one lap after Panis and the mess at turnone.<p>Tora Takagi lost it under braking at the first corner coming up from theback part of the field, did a 180 degree spin, clipped Jarno Trulli and ranintothe side of a Minardi, which in turn forced off Johnny Herbert, with botheventually continuing. The other Minardi of Rosset was blocked momentarilybehind Takagi's damaged car sans rear wing.<p>Coming up to turn two on the same lap, the field was still ruthlessly dicingfor any and all advantage. Under braking, Pedro Diniz dived in front ofJacques Villeneuve, causing the Canadian to squirrel the car under braking.Diniz, on the inside and carrying too much speed then lost it and clipped theright rear tire of team-mate Mika Salo, spinning the Finn's car around andpuncturing the tire. <p>Diniz continued on, ran into and spun David Coulthard's car around and aswell in the same incident and also momentarily blocked Villeneuve, who hadto tip-toe around the wrecking yard.<p>Salo, trying to right his car, spun-turned it and in the process his leftrear banged into and broke Coulthard's front wing in the midst of trying toget going again. Salo was by then also out of the race.<p>Lap one retirements: Panis, Takagi, Salo.<p>Pits: Coulthard for new front wing.<p>The safety car following the back of the field after the start was orderedto stay out for one lap after Panis and the messes at turns one and two.<p>The safety car was then quickly called in and race restarted in single file.<p>Starting from third on the grid Mika Hakkinen (one-stop strategy) sailed pastGiancarlo Fisichella (on pole) and Jean Alesi (2nd) into the lead by thefirst corner and never looked back. M. Schumacher (2-stops) gets by both aswell into 2nd.<p>On lap three, Hakkinen, running a medium-high downforce setup held off a hardcharging M. Schumacher running a low downforce setup for the first severallaps after the restart. Once Schumacher looked as if he might get by, buthe had to concede the corner after running a little wide and in the processlost second to Fisichella.<p>Lap four. Jos Verstappen taps Alexander Wurz from behind, forcing theAustrian's Benetton to take to the gravel and rejoins.<p>Lap five. MS using all of the straight-line speed advantage of the Ferraritakes advantage of Fisichella this time running wide and retakes second.<p>Lap six. Coulthard down in 14th and rapidly coming up through field.Schumacher chasing down Hakkinen and catches the Finn's rear wing, tryinginside and outside pass attempts and each time foiled by Hakkinen.<p>Lap eight. Reubens Barrichello pits and retires with terminal problem.Hakkinen and Schumacher (+0.5s) begin to trade off fastest laps.<p>Lap 14. Coulthard (14th) catches convoy of 10th to 13th (Herbert,Villeneuve, Ralf Schumacher, and Damon Hill) Hill courteously lets Coulthardby who and waves in thanks. Coulthard eventually gets by all.<p>Lap 16. M. Schumacher maintaining gap behind Hakkinen runs wide again at thefinal turn, bounces hard across the gravel and destroys the front wing. Thelocation is the worst possible place (just after the pit entrance) and meanshaving to go around a whole lap with no front downforce, losing positionsalong the way. Fischella and Eddie Irvine get by.<p>Heinz-Harald Frentzen's engine blows up.<p>Lap 17. Schumacher pits and emerges at back of the field about 15-20 secondsahead of race leader Hakkinen.<p>Lap 19. Coulthard fastest lap.<p>Lap 21. Fisichella pits, re-enters track side-by-side with Alesi whoout-brakes the Italian on the outside line going into turn two. Fisichella,depsite being a car length behind Alesi, refuses to concede the corner anddrives into the side of the Frenchman. Fisichella ends up in gravel and out.Alesi tries to right the car but stalls the engine. Both cars out.<p>Lap 25. Full screen shots of Coulthard's girlfriend Heidi.<p>Lap 27. Villenueve trying to get by Trulli, goes wide and takes a minor tripthrough the gravel and rejoins.<p>Lap 33. Coulthard, fastest car on the track, takes 2nd place and never looksback. Verstappen gets by Wurz.<p>And after that? Coulthard's engine or transmission begins to emit smokeunder 2nd gear acceleration. Nothing terminal.<p>Esteban Tuero ends race by spinning off into gravel.<p>Verstappen's engine blows up and showers oil on the rear tires and spins itaround to a stop and retires.<p>More shots of Heidi, now smiling.<p>Schumacher's off that damaged front wing throws his pitstops out of sync.Elects to take on enough fuel at half distance to go to the end. As a resultIrvine is in third place ahead of MS.  Irvine discreetly drops 2-3 secondsoff lap times and with a handful laps to go moves over like a wet noodle ina thunderstorm.<p>Martin Brundle, to a tee, predicts Ferrari's excuse for Irvine's slowtimes -- "Spongy brakes." James Allen comes on with confirmation from JeanTodt that Irvine has a brake problem, all three of Brundle, Murray, andAllen break into a laugh.<p>Processional finish.<p><PRE>1. Hakkinen2. Coulthard3. M. Schumacher4. Fisichella5. R. Schumacher6. Villeneuve</PRE>     <br clear=all><p><center><hr noshade><A HREF="http://www.electric.on.net"        onMouseOver="waxon('home');        statuson('home'); return true;"        onMouseOut="statusoff(); waxoff('home');        return true;"><IMG name=home SRC="../buttons/butt_home_off.gif" ALT="home" WIDTH="140" HEIGHT="32" BORDER="0"></a><A HREF="../sport/index.html"        onMouseOver="waxon('sport');        statuson('sport'); return true;"        onMouseOut="statusoff(); waxoff('sport');        return true;"><IMG name=sport SRC="../buttons/butt_sport_off.gif" ALT="sport" WIDTH="140" HEIGHT="32" BORDER="0"></a><hr noshade></center><p><A HREF="http://www.electric.on.net">http://www.electric.on.net</A><p>&copy; This work is subject to copyright.
