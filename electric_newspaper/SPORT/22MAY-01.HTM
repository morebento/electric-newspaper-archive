The question now is whether the injury toll Adelaide paid      in limiting the sixth placed Eels to two tries last weekend has      compromised their ability to compete with 13th placed Penrith on      Saturday night at Adelaide Oval.     <p>     The Rams injury toll is reaching epidemic proportions.     <p>     The unfortunate early round losses of the consistently sure Rod Maybon      at fullback and the talented Craig Kimmorley at five-eighth for the      season were bad enough.  The Rams have now also lost four more players      from injuries sustained against Parramatta.     <p>     In a major disappointment, "big Bruce" Mamando is out for the season      after just one game back from a previous injury he incurred almost a      year ago.  He is the second Rams forward gone for the year, joining      Dave Boughton.      <p>     More bad news for Adelaide is that established centre Peter Clarke      injured his knee and is out for probably six weeks, no thanks to      Parramatta's NZ test star, Jarrod ("Crack'em") McCracken, who copped a      paltry one match suspension for that "tackle".     <p>     Three-quarter Luke Williamson, who was stretchered off in a neck brace      last Friday night, is also out for at least a week.  He's lucky that      the damage wasn't worse.  Sadly, he is Adelaide's leading pointscorer      this season.     <p>     Speedy Wayne Simonds, who did a reasonably good job covering wing,      fullback and centre in early round matches, is also out injured for      six weeks.     <p>     Versatile and reliable Chris Quinn, who this season has played      five-eighth, centre and full-back, has not yet fully recovered from a      broken finger and is unavailable for the game against the Panthers.     <p>     Things are so grim that Rams coach Dean Lance has named second row      forward Tony Iro in the centres.  The fourth interchange player for      Saturday's game, Bird, has been rushed up from Redcliff in Brisbane.     <p>     The Rams are bottom of the table with only one win from ten attempts      and are now scraping the bottom of their talent barrel.     <p>     Lance has shrewdly held the backline as close to intact as possible,      given the nonavailability of so many players.     <p>     Graham Appo gets his third game in a row at fullback since joining the      team in the wake of the dumping of former coach Reddy.  Mat Daylight      and Rod Jensen hold their spots on the wings.  Iro moves from the pack      to join David Kidwell (promoted from the interchange bench) in the      centres.  Craig Bowen (five-eighth) and Noel Goldthorpe (half-back) are      inside them as usual.     <p>     Dean Schifilitti ("Schiffers") starts at lock again.  Under Rod Reddy,      Schiffers and Kerrod Walters alternated at hooker/dummy-half, but      Lance has left Walters in the specialist spot he previously made his      own for Brisbane and Australia.     <p>     This seems like good sense from Lance.  Better to have both Schifilitti      and Walters on the field at the same time, than having one or the other      on the bench for most of the game.     <p>     With Iro shifted to the centres, Adam Peek moves from the bench to the      second row alongside regular Alan Cann.  Mark Corvo starts in the      front row as usual, with Walters beside him in the scrum.  Lanky Marty      McKenzie, who wasn't in the team to meet the Eels, displaces Andrew      Hick to the bench and gets the other prop position.     <p>     Dean Lance has done well to minimise the effects these recent injuries      have had on the structure of the Rams.  He is clearly working on      establishing some key combinations on the field.       <p>     Really, the injuries have left him with limited options.     <p>     Yesterday's announcement that Kerrod Walters has been restored to the      captaincy is another positive step.     <p>     Penrith's forwards are unlikely to cause their opposite numbers in the      Rams many serious problems, but their backs ... well they're another      matter entirely.     <p>     The Panthers have been inconsistent but have still managed four wins.       They have also been hit hard by injuries but have had some key players      return recently with more to come back soon.     <p>     Despite most of the Panthers being ill last week, they courageously      held off a late challenge from the overachieving 11th placed Tigers      (32-12) on Sunday.     <p>     Penrith have been strengthened since that match with the return from      injury of Ryan Girdler, Jody Gall, Brad Drew and Duncan MacGillvray.       Also coming back from suspension is fullback Peter Jorgenson.     <p>     By all accounts, their halfback Greg ("Brandy") Alexander and      five-eighth Steve Carter had very good games against Balmain.  Both      know when and how to run and when and how to pass.     <p>     This is why their centre Girdler was the leading try scorer last      season.  He's very close to top of the list this season too.     <p>     If Penrith get sufficient time with the ball, Brandy and Carter will      provide excellent precision passes to the Panthers clever running      three-quarters.  Between them, this established inside combination      have played over 400 first grade games for Penrith.     <p>     The inexperience of Adelaide's outside backs and the often poor      positional play of fullback Appo are sure to be tested.     <p>     Indeed, if Brandy and Carter aren't contained by Goldthorpe and Bowen      inside then the Rams will be cut to pieces out wide.     <p>     Has the Rams improved away peformance and the settling of the      captaincy issue lifted team confidence enough to record their second      win of 1998?     <p>     Or will Penrith repeat their 54-12 demolition of Adelaide six weeks      ago?     <p>     I'll find out at the centre-line on Saturday night.  See you there!     <p>     <pre>     RAMS                       PANTHERS     Coach: Dean Lance          Coach: Royce Simmons          Starting Lineup            Starting Lineup          1.
