I lost count      of the number of times Adelaide fumbled the ball.       <p>     Adelaide's biggest problem was lack of respect for the ball.  In a      competition as intense and fierce as the National Rugby League, points      are difficult to score against all opposition.  Adelaide do not seem      to understand that you need to have the ball in your hands to score      tries.     <p>     Yet the Rams scored two tries against themselves by passing the ball      directly to their opponents.  These costly errors were the differences      between the two sides on the night.     <p>     A worse performance is hard to imagine.     <p>     Adelaide half-back Noel Goldthorpe had a major shocker.  He knocked on      several times, threw passes to no one, threw one pass clean over the      side line and was tackled with the ball on several occasions.  These      are almost terminal offences for a half-back.     <p>     Goldthorpe could not sell a dummy to a nursing mother, let alone his      opposite number Wes Patten.  The Charger's half-back, by contrast, was      a constant threat with the ball in his hands.  He is very nimble and      slippery.  Patten also managed to play off-side in defence throughout      the game.  Neither the referee nor the touch judges seemed to mind on      most occasions.     <p>     Goldthorpe's obvious replacement, Craig Kimmorly, is unfortunately not      available for the rest of the season.  Sadly, he sustained a serious      ankle injury during the game.  Playing at five-eighth, Kimmorly set up      Adelaide's only major score of the game with a well judged inside pass      to Iro about 40 metres out.  Iro hit the ball at speed and was stopped      by the desperate Chargers cover defence a couple of metres short of      the tryline. Dean Schiffilliti backed up and scored under the posts.       It was a good reward for these three, although Iro was also guilty of      some poor handling on other occasions.     <p>     Adelaide's prospects for the season were further deflated by serious      injuries to hard working forwards Marty McKenzie and Brett Galea.  The      Rams finished the match against the Gold Coast with an empty bench, so      serious was the damage inflicted by the Chargers.     <p>     Kerrod Walters (hooker and dummy-half), Chris Quinn (full-back) and      Alan Cann (front row forward) produced their typical high class      efforts.  Wingers Joe Tamani and Luke Williamson tried hard to get      involved but the ball rarely got to the inside backs, so atrocious was      the Rams handling around the ruck area.  Adelaide centre Peter Clarke      showed exceptional speed to run down the Charger's full back and      prevent a Gold Coast try.     <p>     Coach Rod Reddy and half Goldthorpe must have had a very interesting      conversation after the match.     <p>     So where does this leave Adelaide with one fifth of the regular season      gone?  Sharing 14th with Canterbury, Wests, Illawarra, Manly, Gold      Coast and South Sydney, who all have won one and lost five.  On points      scored and points conceded, only South Sydney (54-130) rank below      Adelaide (56-130).     <p>     One suspects that Adelaide may have to crash right to the bottom      before they can turn this around.  Their next opponents are Sydney      City (3 wins 2 losses).  This could be a repeat of the debacle against      Penrith on the Rams last trip to Sydney.     <br clear=all><p><center><hr noshade><A HREF="http://www.electric.on.net"        onMouseOver="waxon('home');        statuson('home'); return true;"        onMouseOut="statusoff(); waxoff('home');        return true;"><IMG name=home SRC="../buttons/butt_home_off.gif" ALT="home" WIDTH="140" HEIGHT="32" BORDER="0"></a><A HREF="../sport/index.html"        onMouseOver="waxon('sport');        statuson('sport'); return true;"        onMouseOut="statusoff(); waxoff('sport');        return true;"><IMG name=sport SRC="../buttons/butt_sport_off.gif" ALT="sport" WIDTH="140" HEIGHT="32" BORDER="0"></a><hr noshade></center><p><A HREF="http://www.electric.on.net">http://www.electric.on.net</A><p>&copy; This work is subject to copyright.
