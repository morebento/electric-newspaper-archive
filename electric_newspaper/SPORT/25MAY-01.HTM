Ramrookies Bowen, Bird and Appo combined brilliantly on Adelaide's firstpossession to score an 80 metre try and put the visiting Penrith Panthersbehind 6-0 inside the first two minutes if the match.<p>The stunned Panthers took too long to recover from the early setback.  TheRams went on to record their second win of the season with an impressiveand emphatic 35-16 victory.<p>The young backline combination Adelaide fielded on Saturday night showedagility, speed, handling and surprising coolness under pressure.  The Ramsfinally seem to have attacking options out wide to capitalise on thetypically strong performances of their forwards.<p>The Panthers have been performing inconsistently this year.  Their strengthis their big, fast, skilled and seasoned backline led by the great GregAlexander.  However, they were completely outplayed by the young Adelaidethree-quarters, intelligently positioned and fed by Adelaide half-back NoelGoldthorpe.<p>Outside 'Thorpie', Craig Bowen (five-eighth), Dave Kidwell, Graham Appo(centres), Rod Jensen, Mat Daylight (wingers) and NSL first-grade debutantDion Bird (full-back) played extremely well.<p>Adversity can do some strange things.  Forced to make changes and findsubstitutes to cover injuries to regular squad members, Adelaide coach DeanLance sent out a backline of unheralded players that produced more than anyother previous Rams combination.<p>Warning bells were ringing for Penrith from the moment Adelaide firsthandled the ball.<p>Penrith received Adelaide's opening kick-off and completed six playssuccessfully despite energetic and committed tackling by the Rams. GregAlexander's punt kick on the sixth play found the west touchline 20 metresfrom the Adelaide tryline.<p>From the play-the-ball after the regulation scrum, a short pass from CraigBowen found Dion Bird speeding into a gap.  Bird went through and foundAppo in support on his left.  He passed to Appo who then rocketed 70 metresdownfield, outpaced Panther's flyer Robbie Beckett and touched down.  Appoconverted his own try with a good place kick from out wide aided by afollowing south-westerly wind.<p>After three minutes, it was Rams 6 Panthers 0.<p>When Penrith first managed to get some ball and some territory, it wasclear that their tactics were designed to neutralise Adelaide's forwards,their recognised strength.  However, the Panther's game plan backfired.<p>The Rams forwards stuck to their task, ignoring Penrith's nigglingdistractions, and made good ground through and near the rucks.  Eventually,Penrith were trapped in their goal area and forced to drop kick out frombetween their posts.<p>Attempts to rattle the Rams forwards finally came to the attention ofreferee Mogsheen Jadwat.  He penalised Panther's front row forward MatAdamson for a head-high tackle on his opposite Mark Corvo about 25 metresout and smack in front of the Penrith goal posts.<p>Appo slotted the penalty place kick through the uprights and Adelaide led8-0 after six minutes.<p>A Ram's knock-on after the restart gave the Panthers the loose-head andput-in to a scrum set on halfway.  Penrith squandered their first chance toget into the game by spilling the ball.<p>Adelaide could do little wrong and everything Penrith touched turned togrit in this period.<p>Adelaide's second try followed a good break from Tony Iro who sheddedseveral tackles advancing the Rams territorially.  Goldthorpe nicelyweighted a grubber behind the Penrith defensive line and second rower MarkCorvo was on the spot to pick up the crumbs and touch down.  Appo convertedwith a good place kick from out wide.<p>Fifteen minutes gone and it was Adelaide 14 Penrith 0.<p>Adelaide's forwards maintained their concentration and intensity of effort. Goldthorpe exploited this with long kicks into touch.  This drove thePanthers back into their own territory and gave his forwards little'breathers' as the scrums were set.<p>Penrith made very heavy weather trying to get out of their own territory inthe face of smothering Adelaide defence.<p>The Ram's territorial stranglehold was finally broken by a great bust fromPanther's second row forward Jody Gall that gave his team great fieldposition.  Penrith did not waste their second opportunity in Adelaideterritory.<p>On Adelaide's next possession, Penrith 'points machine' Ryan Girdleradeptly anticipated a long soaring cut-out pass from Goldthorpe to bag a 30metre intercept try.  Girdler easily kicked the conversion.  After 23minutes, Penrith were on the board trailing 6-14.<p>Girler's try lifted Penrith and their intensity increased in attack anddefence.  Lock Don Cross produced a big tackle-busting burst up the middle. Adelaide started conceding penalties for infringing the tackled Penrithball carrier attempting to play the ball.<p>During this period, a very threatening Penrith raid down the easterntouchline was brought to an emphatic fullstop by a try saving tackle fromDave Kidwell.<p>Adelaide simply refused to buckle under pressure.  Penrith became a littleanxious and frustrated.  They pushed one pass too many and turned the ballover.<p>The Ram's forwards, sparked by a timely dummy half run from winger MatDaylight, rolled Penrith behind the advantage line on successive plays.Adelaide prop forward Mart McKenzie then made a big break on the right.Desperate Penrith defence subsequently stopped Dion Bird just short of atry when the Rams ran on a sixth tackle play.<p>At this stage, Penrith were really struggling to get out of their half.<p>They were then dealt a cruel blow when half-back Alexander painfully hurthis shoulder after being tackled late.  He was forced to retire.  Penrithwere to sorely miss Alexander's cool genius in the second half when thegame was there to be taken by the visitors.<p>Worse was to come for Penrith when their centres unleashed a dangerouslooking attack down the western side two minutes before half-time.  A verypoor pass intended for Panthers flanker Beckett found unmarked Rams wingerRod Jensen, who raced 80 metres to touch down in the north western corner.Appo's conversion kick failed but Adelaide went to the break accompanied bya standing ovation leading 18-6.<p>It was a good lead but not a match-winning break.  When play resumed, thePanther's commitment remained as intense as it was in the latter period ofthe first half.  Their cause was considerably helped during this period bya succession of penalties awarded to them by referee Jadwat againstAdelaide defenders again interfering in the play-the-ball. <p>Penrith were however denied by solid Adelaide defence and by counterattacks from Rams skipper Kerrod Walters and Kiwi international Kevin Iro.<p>The weight of possession and penalty driven territorial advantage trappedthe Rams inside their own in goal area twice in this period.<p>In what was to turn out to be the critical phase of the match, Adelaiderepeatedly answered a determined Penrith in defence and attack.  Again theRams rookies featured.<p>Jensen, Bird and Appo combined well in defence to drive a Penrith attackinto touch just short of the tryline in the north east corner.  Then Appo,Kidwell, Iro and Corvo successively made hard metres to drive Penrithbackwards.<p>Sixteen minutes into the second half, the persistent Panthers were finallyrewarded when Carter and Girdler combined with Sid Domic to put theirfullback Peter Jorgenson over for a try.  Girdler's conversion place kickwas successful.<p>Penrith were coming back at 12-18.<p>It was the closest they were to get.<p>From the resumption, Penrith immediately tore into the Rams defence,trapping them in goal once again at the 20 minute mark of the second half.<p>An unforced Panther's error let Adelaide off the hook.  They fumbled thedrop out catch and Jadwat ordered a scrum set 5 metres inside Adelaideterritory with an Adelaide feed and loose head.  This was the turning pointof the game.<p>Ahead by only a converted try, the Rams pressured the Panthers, lifted by agreat run from five-eighth Craig Bowen.<p>The small frozen crowd gave Jadwat a 'Bronx' cheer when he then awardedAdelaide their first penalty for 20 minutes about 15 metres inside theiropponent's half.  Appo stepped up to take the punt for the line.  Kickinginto the wind, he drove the ball over the eastern sideline only 5 metresshort of Penrith's tryline.<p>The damp ball, slippery surface and player fatigue were now contributing tohandling errors by both teams.  It was evident how much Penrith missedAlexander when they made a complete mess of their kick on a sixth tackle play.<p>For Adelaide, forwards Mark Corvo and Adam Peek were bursting through thedefence at will.  Penrith continued to make errors as the possibility of aloss started to become a reality for them.<p>Sensing an Adelaide win, the crowd urged the Rams onwards.<p>Adam Peek and then Noel Goldthorpe made great busts up the middle and RodJensen came within less than a metre of touching down in the south-eastcorner.<p>Penrith recovered the ball but spilled it on their first play inside theirown ten metres.<p>By now the exhausted Panthers were consistently falling off tackles.Kerrod Walters almost got through for a try running from dummy half about15 metres out.<p>Again Penrith regained possession and again they surrendered it almostimmediately.<p>Then the game took an interesting twist, starting with the loopiest fieldgoal you could imagine from Andrew Pierce.<p>After 66 minutes, Adelaide 19 Penrith 12.<p>Needing to score twice to win, Penrith completely dropped their bundle.Recognising this, the Rams decided to come out and play.  And didn't theyenjoy themselves!<p>Twenty-three points were scored in last ten minutes of the game on top ofthe previous 31!<p>Ram's lock forward Dean Schifilitti opened festivities with a long powerfulburst up the centre of the ruck.  Then Craig Bower sliced through thedefence, punted high over the fullback‘s head and raced through to securethe ball under a tackle one metre out.  Rod Jensen raced through insupport, scooped up the ball and dived over to touch down from dummy-half.<p>Adelaide 23 Penrith 12 in the 72nd minute.  Game over!<p>Appo missed a difficult place kick into the breeze attempting to convertthe try but Adelaide went straight back into top gear from the kickrestart.  Iro cruised straight through the wilting defence.  Then Corvoeasily pushed clear into space and passed inside to the exuberantSchifilitti who scored a try under the crossbar.  Appo added the extras.<p>Adelaide 29 Penrith 12.<p>The Rams fumbled the kick off and Dean McGillivray scored a consolation tryfor Penrith that Girdler converted.<p>Adelaide 29 Penrith 18.<p>Appo then produced a piece of magic to entertain the hardy band of rugbyleague loyalists that braved the chilly conditions.  He kicked off low andshallow and regathered the ball in front of a bemused panther's front row.Goldthorpe then sliced straight through the centre and ran 25 metres beforeunloading to Appo who scored the Rams sixth try of the night.  Appoconverted from in front on full-time.<p>Adelaide 35 Penrith 18<p>The Ram's clearly enjoyed the response of their hardy supporters after thegame.<p>Next week Adelaide meet Western Suburbs at Campbelltown.  An away win willsee them move off the bottom of the premiership ladder.<p><center><hr noshade><A HREF="http://www.electric.on.net"        onMouseOver="waxon('home');        statuson('home'); return true;"        onMouseOut="statusoff(); waxoff('home');        return true;"><IMG name=home SRC="../buttons/butt_home_off.gif" ALT="home" WIDTH="140" HEIGHT="32" BORDER="0"></a><A HREF="../sport/index.html"        onMouseOver="waxon('sport');        statuson('sport'); return true;"        onMouseOut="statusoff(); waxoff('sport');        return true;"><IMG name=sport SRC="../buttons/butt_sport_off.gif" ALT="sport" WIDTH="140" HEIGHT="32" BORDER="0"></a><hr noshade></center><p><A HREF="http://www.electric.on.net">http://www.electric.on.net</A><p>&copy; This work is subject to copyright.
