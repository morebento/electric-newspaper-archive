Before therace, McLaren's Mika Hakkinen had predicted that no-one would come closeto the McLarens in the race. Michael Schumacher, however, was predictingthat the Ferraris could split the McLarens. As qualifying drew on it cameclear that Ferrari had well and truly made headway with the changes madeto the Ferrari, including the new Goodyear front tyres. As a result it wasa fired up Coulthard on pole, with Schumacher second.<p>      Hakkinen, however, had a torrid time in qualifying and never reallyseemed to get it together.  Irvine looked set at one point to hit pole,until he unexpectedly suddenly hit a 'problem' during a lap which was 0.3seconds inside Schumachers pole time.<p>   Back from the top two teams the Williams' looked distinctly ordinary,whilst Jordan continued their unpredictable form, with Ralf in the top 6and Hill inside the top 10. Sauber also hit problems, and Johnny Herbertwas not a happy bunny. Several teams ran the rather horrible lookingwinglets on the side pods, including Sauber, Tyrrell and Jordan.<p>   Come the race and the weather had a chance of rain. Schumacher ranthrough the pits several times before the start of the race beforesettling on his race car rather than the t-car for the start. Rumoursabounded that the Bridgestones were too hard for the South American track,and that that may cause problems in the race. It looked that theBridgestone runners wouldn't have any trouble with a one stop strategy,and could probably go a race on them such was the state of the rubber! TheGoodyear runners were expected to go for a two stop strategy, and indeedmost of them were to do so. <p>  At the start it was the McLaren of Coulthard that lead the way, with ahard charging Schumacher keeping up with him. Only five laps into the raceand Coulthard's lead at the front was in trouble. He was not looking goodon the track, and suddenly he ran rather wide, allowing a hard chargingMichael into the lead. The McLaren suffered damage to the undertray, andwhilst Coulthard said that he wasn't happy with the move after the race,it was obvious to all who saw it that really, it was Coulthard's mistake. <p>   From there Schuey started to build up a lead as seen from the McLarensin previous races. This was a massive improvement in form from the Ferraricamp. Whether it is only the slower-twistier tracks that suits the Ferrariremains to be seen. Ralf Schumacher, meanwhile, was in trouble and for thethird race in succession he spun off the track. <p>  Behind the top two teams the rest looked distinctly ordinary. Goodracing was going on through the whole of the field, and there actually wasovertaking! But from the start it was clear that barring bizarremisfortune to the McLaren's and Ferrari's this was to be their race oneway or the other, and it really looked good for the Ferraris. The mainpoint of discussion was whether a hard charging Schumacher on a two stopstrategy could do enough to make up the difference to McLaren's onestopper. This was soon settled with it rapidly becoming clear that Schueycould easily control the race. <p>   Unusual moments in the race included Jean Alesi tanging with his pitcrew and removing one of the daft winglets. It didn't affect his race atall, and out of the two Saubers it was Jeans that was the pace setter,rapidly making progress from his lowley starting point to the top 6.Either the winglets did nothing to the Sauber, or the team have found amajor improvement by removing one of them......... <p>   Jean's team mate, Johnny Herbert, meanwhile was not having such a goodrace. He tangled with Damon Hill and was out of the race. Damon removedhis front wing, but managed to keep going, and got to the finish in 8th. <p>   Just outside the top two teams was a hard charging Alexander Wurz, whocontinues to impress in the Benetton. He made the best of the car over therace, and managed some superb moves on other drivers. <p>   When the champagne was sprayed, Schumacher stood atop the podiumflanked by Hakkinen, who finished second, and his team mate Eddie Irvine. Wurz, Alesi and Coulthard rounded out the points paying positions. <p>   For the first time in some time we had real racing going on on thetrack, rather than everything being decided in the pit lane. Let's hopethat this is a sign of things to come! <p><center><hr noshade><A HREF="http://www.electric.on.net"        onMouseOver="waxon('home');        statuson('home'); return true;"        onMouseOut="statusoff(); waxoff('home');        return true;"><IMG name=home SRC="../buttons/butt_home_off.gif" ALT="home" WIDTH="140" HEIGHT="32" BORDER="0"></a><A HREF="../sport/index.html"        onMouseOver="waxon('sport');        statuson('sport'); return true;"        onMouseOut="statusoff(); waxoff('sport');        return true;"><IMG name=sport SRC="../buttons/butt_sport_off.gif" ALT="sport" WIDTH="140" HEIGHT="32" BORDER="0"></a><hr noshade></center><p><A HREF="http://www.electric.on.net">http://www.electric.on.net</A><p>&copy; This work is subject to copyright.
