Ten teams will contest the September playoffs and the tenth placedside will probably finish with 24-26 points from 12 to 13 wins.<p>For the Rams to make the playoffs, they would need to win at least ten oftheir last thirteen regular games.  Their form indicates this is out of thequestion, despite the exciting promise that their new outside backs add totheir traditional forward strength.<p>Adelaide face in sequence Western Suburbs (18th), St George (1st),Melbourne (3rd), Illawarra (13th), Gold Coast (20th), Balmain (9th), SouthSydney (17th), North Queensland (12th), Auckland (15th), Brisbane (4th),Manly (16th), North Sydney (7th) and Newcastle (1st) to complete the minorrounds.<p>Assuming Adelaide victories against all of their opponents currentlyoutside the top ten and losses only to the high flying Dragons, Knights andBroncos, the Rams would still have to beat other top ten teams the Storm,Sea Eagles and Bears to win ten out of the next thirteen.  Not impossible,but not likely either.<p>Adelaide can realistically make the top fifteen however.  It all startsthis week.<p>South Sydney, Western Suburbs, Adelaide and Gold Coast are involved in asignificant series of Round 12 matches this weekend as the inauguralNational Rugby League competition reaches the half way mark.<p>These four teams are at the bottom of the standings with only two winsapiece for four premiership points.  On percentages of points scored overconceded, Souths (66%) are 17th, Wests are 18th (61%), Adelaide are 19th(49%) and Gold Coast are 20th (47%).<p>Fourteenth, 15th and 16th placed Penrith, Auckland and Manly on eightpremiership points each are two wins clear of the four-pack in the cellar.<p>The cellar is going to be rearranged this weekend.<p>The Gold Coast CHARGERS have a difficult task advancing when they hostjoint competition leaders the St George DRAGONS at Carrara.  Saints havejust won eight games straight.<p>The task facing the Souths RABBITOHS is probably even more difficult.  Theytravel to Marathon Stadium to face the Newcastle KNIGHTS, the otherco-leaders of the premiership.<p>The Wests MAGPIES and the Adelaide RAMS ... well, they play each other.<p>This is a once in a season chance to pass the wooden spoon to somebody else.<p>Rams supporters might think things are tough.  Traditional Magpie diehardsKNOW what tough is.<p>Wests miserable season so far reads in sequence as follows: they wereoutclassed by St George (18-36) and beaten by Melbourne (16-26) before theycompletely annihilated Souths (42-6). They were then brought down to earthwhen they were squashed by Newcastle (18-34), creamed by Sydney City (22-4)and buried by Souths (10-41).  They were competitive in their next gamelosing to St George (8-12) and then blown away by Melbourne (16-54).  Theywere then tortured by Illawarra (20-42). They beat Gold Coast (24-14) andsubsequently lost to Balmain (12-20).<p>Adelaide's record is only slightly worse: they were beaten by NorthQueensland (8-18) and then by Manly (6-22) before they outmuscledCanterbury (22-20).  They then collapsed completely against Penrith(12-54), lost to Gold Coast (8-16), capitulated to Sydney City (12-50) andwere outskilled by Cronulla (12-22).  Things got decidedly worse whenCanterbury turned them into a rack of lamb (30-4).  Rod Reddy was then toldhis services were no longer required as coach.  Under Dean (“Communicator”)Lance the Rams went down by a converted try to Canberra (18-24), werecompetitive against powerful Parramatta (2-10) and looked the goods againstPenrith (35-18).<p>The Wests-Adelaide confrontation is an important milestone for both teams.Both are struggling but improving.  Both believe they can win this one.And they're right!<p>The game will be played in Sydney.<p>Of course these days the players and the coaches “only look ahead at thenext game, doing it one match at a time”, but ... there's an excellentchance that the winner between the Rams and Magpies will close within onewin of the three-pack that is currently two wins above them.<p>Auckland are travelling this weekend, which they do just as badly asAdelaide.  The Warriors face the sixth placed Eels at Parramatta and areyet to win away from Ericsson Stadium.  Tough to predict an Auckland winthere.<p>Penrith will host North Queensland, who are in the middle of a slump.  TheCowboys clawed out a win against the Raiders in Townsville last weekend toreverse the trend but Penrith win most games at home.  Could be close.<p>The Bulldogs host the Sea Eagles at Belmore.  Canterbury were completelydisgraced by the Broncos in Brisbane last week whereas Manly put thecleaners through the Sharks.  Both teams have been inconsistent.  Couldeasily go either way.<p>While I'll admit that everyone, myself included, is having a hell of a timepredicting winners this season ... and that's a good thing, I'm notcomplaining ... the chances of Auckland and Penrith and Manly ALL recordingwins this round is not high.<p>I expect Adelaide to beat Wests at Campbelltown and close the gap on the17th placed Auckland to two points.<p>They need to.  Because the following week the St George juggernaught willarrive at Adelaide Oval.  The Dragons, of course, have played more games inAdelaide than any other visiting team.  Also, the recently dismissed Ramscoaching staff came from the Saints.  There's bound to be some feeling there.<p><center><hr noshade><A HREF="http://www.electric.on.net"        onMouseOver="waxon('home');        statuson('home'); return true;"        onMouseOut="statusoff(); waxoff('home');        return true;"><IMG name=home SRC="../buttons/butt_home_off.gif" ALT="home" WIDTH="140" HEIGHT="32" BORDER="0"></a><A HREF="../sport/index.html"        onMouseOver="waxon('sport');        statuson('sport'); return true;"        onMouseOut="statusoff(); waxoff('sport');        return true;"><IMG name=sport SRC="../buttons/butt_sport_off.gif" ALT="sport" WIDTH="140" HEIGHT="32" BORDER="0"></a><hr noshade></center><p><A HREF="http://www.electric.on.net">http://www.electric.on.net</A><p>&copy; This work is subject to copyright.
