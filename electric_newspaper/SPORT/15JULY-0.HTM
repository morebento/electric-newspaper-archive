Amazingly, the Adelaide Rams have      scored 126 and conceded 30 points in their last three matches.  They      aim for four wins in a row this Saturday in Townsville.     <p>     The "Clipsal Adelaide Rams" have come a long way in the last two      months.     <p>     While other clubs delay signing players for next year pending      amalgamation discussions for the year 2000 comp, the Adelaide Rugby      League Football club is offering three year deals to players coming      off contracts at the end of this year.  They believe that the Rams      will make the "last fourteen" of the NRL next century.     <p>     The players and supporters are doing their best to ensure the dream      comes true.  The SACA and the SANFL have helped in their perverse way.     <p>     With enthusiastic fans now lining both touchlines at Hindmarsh, the      atmosphere was electric at the first game at the new home.  And didn't      the Rams wingers love it!     <p>     Crowd support is a big factor for players, coaches and for team      survival in the compressed competition of the future.     <p>     So far this year, Sydney teams are averaging 10,000 fans per game      whereas the non-Sydney siders are averaging 13,500.  Brisbane,      Newcastle and Melbourne are the big drawcards.     <p>     The Rams are averaging 7,400 for home games this year, down on last      year's Super League achievement of a healthy 15,300.     <p>     Western Suburbs (the Magpies, based in Campbelltown, Sydney) have a      similar average home attendance.  Gold Coast (6,400) and South Sydney      (6,200) are faring worse.     <p>     The Rams have managed to put their act together recently.     <p>     After ten of the 24 rounds of the regular season the Rams were stone      motherless last in the standings with one (narrow) win to their      credit.  Eight rounds later they are 16th in the 20 team national      competition with six wins.     <p>     Original coach Rod Reddy was in charge for the first eight games.       Under his direction, Adelaide had triumphed only once, over Canterbury      22-20.  Under current coach Dean Lance, the Rams have won five from      ten.     <p>     Adelaide's polished and disciplined display at Hindmarsh Stadium in      round 17 was a genuine joy to witness.  They showed their dedicated      supporters they have strength, skill, speed and, most importantly,      confidence as they first stood up to, then wore down and finally      absolutely flogged 12th placed Balmain Tigers 52-0 in a display      reminiscent of Canberra or Brisbane at full flight.     <p>     Their execution was ruthless.     <p>     Clearly, the Rams are no longer the easybeats of the NRL.     <p>     Last weekend they continued the good form by making mincemeat of the      South Sydney Rabbitohs at the Sydney Football Stadium 34-18.     <p>     Once again the Adelaide forwards dominated their opposition and      established a platform for the "Walters and Goldthorpe" show.  Kerrod      Walters (hooker) and Noel Goldthorpe (halfback) used their      considerable skill and experience to create opportunities for their      younger and faster teammates.     <p>     The Rams forwards have played very well all year, but the return of      hard-running Darien Doherty from injury and the acquisition of strong      and tireless Alan Wieland have eased the pressure on Mark Corvo, Alan      Cann, Andrew Hick and Adam Peek.  These are the "unsung" heroes of      Adelaide's recent eye-catching exhibitions.     <p>     Adelaide's backline showed flashes of brilliance in the first half of      the season but has recently displayed lethal form.  Long accurate      passes from Goldthorpe and Walters or short passes from Tony Iro are      now finding flying marks in the shape of Graham Appo, Dave Kidwell,      Mat Daylight, Rod Jensen and Deon Bird.     <p>     These outside backs ("three-quarters"), supported by lock forward Dean      Schifilliti, are blowing holes in the opposition defence out wide.       Just look at what they did to Souths, Balmain and Gold Coast.     <p>     Adelaide has speed to burn out wide.     <p>     The settling of the backline combination has obviously improved the      player's understanding of each other's styles and they've gained      confidence in their teammates to do their designated job in the match      plan.  This has reduced the number of dropped balls, air passes,      knock-ons, fumbles, handovers and turnovers, and thus reduced the      amount of self-inflicted defensive pressure.     <p>     The improved handling and positional play has also been instrumental      in moving the scoreboard rapidly along in the Ram's favour.     <p>     Instrumental in the Rams recent form reversal has been the      performances of Noel Goldthorpe and Kerrod Walters.     <p>     As halfback, "Thorpie" is generally the first receiver and in charge      of strategy and tactics.  His positioning, catching, pass selection      and kicking have been on song for about a month.       <p>     At dummy-half, Walters is the first to handle the ball and clear it to      Goldthorpe or select one of the forwards to receive.       <p>     These classy players are the keys to the Rams attack vehicles.     <p>     Unfortunately, the Rams may be without both next year.     <p>     Sadly for Adelaide supporters we may only have three more      opportunities to see the great Kerrod Walters play again.     <p>     The Rams captain announced this week he would not be with the Adelaide      club in 1999.     <p>     With an eye to the future, Adelaide have signed brilliant young hooker      Luke Priddis from Canberra to a three-year contract, and only offered      the 31 year old veteran a one year deal.     <p>     Kerrod will certainly attract a better offer from elsewhere, probably      from England or New Zealand.     <p>     Those of us who regularly attend Rams home games regard Walters as the      class player of the Rams for both 1997 and 1998.     <p>     Before he came to Adelaide, he played 220 first grade games between      1988 and 1996 for the top-line Brisbane Broncos along side his twin      brother Kevin at five-eighth and their childhood mate Alan ("Alf")      Langer at half-back.  In that time he won a premiership medal with the      trend-setting Broncos.     <p>     During that time he fought a long-running battle with his brother      Steve, then the hooker for the Canberra Raiders, for the favour of the      Queensland and Australian selectors for the chance to wear the State      of Origin maroon and the Australian green and gold.     <p>     Kerrod Walters represented Queensland in three state-of-origin series      and played eight test matches for Australia.  Magnificent      achievements.     <p>     He is the crowd favourite in Adelaide, where his passing, running and      cover-defending skills are greatly appreciated and admired.     <p>     If he stays fit, we may be lucky enough to see this great player      perform again at Hindmarsh Stadium on the afternoon of Saturday 26      July against Auckland, on the weekend of August 7-9 against Manly and      finally on the weekend of August 14-16 against North Sydney in round      23.     <p>     Unless, of course, Adelaide manage to win their next six games against      North Queensland, Auckland, Brisbane, Manly, North Sydney and      Newcastle and make the play-offs!     <p>     So the Rams head north to take on the 13th placed Cowboys in      Townsville on Saturday night.  The game is not televised.     <p>     These teams last met on a rainy Friday night at Adelaide Oval way back      on March 14th in the season opener.  North Queensland won 18-8      basically on Adelaide's dropped ball.     <p>     The northerners went on to successively beat Balmain, Parramatta      (currently 3rd) and Canberra (currently 8th) before their season      imploded in round five when they were annihilated 58-4 in Brisbane by      the Broncos.  They then lost consecutively to a string of top teams:      Newcastle, Sydney City, Cronulla, Canterbury and Parramatta.     <p>     Since then the Cowboys have won against Penrith, Wests and Gold Coast      and lost to St George, Melbourne, Illawarra and most recently to      Balmain.     <p>     They will be tough to beat at home and the humid conditions may not      suit Adelaide.  The 7-30 pm start is a bonus for the Rams, avoiding      the afternoon heat.     <p>     Kerrod Walters will be playing opposite his brother Steve, hooker for      North Queensland.     <p>     Adelaide's team for the Townsville clash contains only minor forced      changes from the recently successful combination.     <p>     Tough, talented and speedy centre Dave Kidwell unfortunately broke his      arm against Souths last weekend.  He is replaced by Danny Grimley who      has been playing impressively off the bench in the last fortnight.     <p>     Adelaide's first choice centre earlier in the season, Peter Clarke,      may get a spot on the interchange for the second week in a row as part      of his rehabilitation following a knee injury two months ago.     <p>     Chris Quinn will be missing at five-eighth courtesy of his "coat      hanger" and the judiciary.     <p>     In a very interesting decision, coach Dean Lance has move Dean      Schifilliti from lock forward to five-eighth.  "Schiffers" came to      Adelaide as an established hooker but has been playing lock for the      last two months and gets better on each outing.     <p>     In the forward pack reshuffle, Tony Iro moves back from second row to      the familiar position of lock, Darien Doherty moves back from the      front row to second row and Andrew Hick comes back from the bench to      start in the front row.     <p>     This is a tough, skilled and generally hard working pack of forwards,      better than the set that easily matched the Cowboys in round one.     <p>     The Adelaide backs are lethal and in exhilarating form.     <p>     The Rams should make it four in a row on Saturday.     <p>     <pre>     TEAMS          Adelaide RAMS v North Queensland COWBOYS at Malanda Stadium,      Townsville     2.30 pm Saturday 18 July          ADELAIDE          Coach  Dean LANCE          Starting Lineup                      1  Deon BIRD                 fullback     2  Matthew DAYLIGHT          right wing      3  Danny GRIMLEY             centre     4  Graham APPO               centre     5  Rod JENSEN                left wing     6  Dean SCHIFILLITI          five-eighth      7  Noel GOLDTHORPE           halfback     8  Andrew HICK               prop (front row) forward      9  Kerrod WALTERS (captain)  hooker     10 Mark CORVO                prop (front row) forward      11 Alan WIELAND              second row forward     12 Darien DOHERTY            second row forward      13 Tony IRO                  lock forward          Interchange (one to be omitted)          14 Andrew PIERCE             forward     15 Luke WILLIAMSON           winger/centre      16 Alan CANN                 forward     17 Peter CLARKE              centre     18 Adam PEEK                 forward          NORTH QUEENSLAND           Coach     Tim Sheen          K Tassell     A Warwick     R Mercy     N Nadruku     J Hannay     A Dunemann     J Ferris     J Death     M Shipway     K Warren     I Roberts (c)     S Walters     J Lomax     </pre>     <p>     Res: S Prince, B Tabuai, O Cunningham, D Fritz, M Locke, J Buttigieg      (two to be omitted).     <br clear=all><p><center><hr noshade><A HREF="http://www.electric.on.net"        onMouseOver="waxon('home');        statuson('home'); return true;"        onMouseOut="statusoff(); waxoff('home');        return true;"><IMG name=home SRC="../buttons/butt_home_off.gif" ALT="home" WIDTH="140" HEIGHT="32" BORDER="0"></a><A HREF="../sport/index.html"        onMouseOver="waxon('sport');        statuson('sport'); return true;"        onMouseOut="statusoff(); waxoff('sport');        return true;"><IMG name=sport SRC="../buttons/butt_sport_off.gif" ALT="sport" WIDTH="140" HEIGHT="32" BORDER="0"></a><hr noshade></center><p><A HREF="http://www.electric.on.net">http://www.electric.on.net</A><p>&copy; This work is subject to copyright.
