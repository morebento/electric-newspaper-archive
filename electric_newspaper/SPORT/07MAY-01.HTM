This remains the RAMS      only win of the season.  Last Sunday the RAMS played the BULLDOGS in a      rematch at Belmore (Sydney).  Every eastern state commentator      predicted a Canterbury win.      <p>     Canterbury thrashed Adelaide 30-4.     <p>     The RAMS have become the joke of rugby league in New South Wales and      Queensland.     <p>     Coach Rod Reddy was given his marching orders on Tuesday.     <p>     On Wednesday, Dean Lance, a former Canberra RAIDERS forward and 1997      coach of the disbanded Superleague team in Perth, the WESTERN REDS,      was given the senior coaching job with the Adelaide Rugby League      Football Club Inc.     <p>     On Friday night, Adelaide host Canberra in a round 9 NRL fixture.     <p>     After completion of one-third of the minor round, the RAIDERS are      currently equal tenth with the BULLDOGS.  The RAMS are equal last with      the MAGPIES (Western Suburbs, Sydney) and the CHARGERS (Gold Coast).     <p>     No-one believes that the Adelaide player list is not superior to that      of Wests and Gold Coast.     <p>     There are twenty teams in the NRL competition in 1998 and ten will      feature in the playoffs in September.     <p>     The RAMS starting lineup that was embarrassed by the BULLDOGS last      Sunday in Sydney was very similar to the team that was very      competitive in their entertaining and spirited loss to the Cronulla      SHARKS last Saturday week in Adelaide.     <p>     In each of their home losses, the RAMS handed scoring opportunities to      their opponents inside their own quarter.  On every occasion, these      unforced errors cost Adelaide a win result.     <p>     Can Adelaide's first thirteen produce a more disciplined display under      their new coach?     <p>     Will New Zealand test hero Tony Iro start at lock for Adelaide?     <p>     Will Kerrod Walters, former Brisbane BRONCOS and Australian test      hooker/dummy-half, be in the starting lineup?     <p>     Can these outstanding players, who have been in good form for the      RAMS, forge a working combination with cool headed half-back Noel      Goldthorpe?     <p>     With quality specialist Rod Maybon still out injured, will Wayne      Simonds get another opportunity at fullback?     <p>     Or has the versatile Chris Quinn recovered from his hand injury and      returned to the custodian role?     <p>     Simonds had no problems at full-back against the SHARKS in defence,      under the high ball, or with the chip and grubber.  He also has a turn      of speed that can hurt the opposing kicking team if he is not properly      contained.       <p>     Simonds must remember, however, that he is not playing on the wing and      keep well away from the touchline on kick returns from deep in his own      territory.     <p>     Will new coach Lance include both Quinn and Simonds, with Quinn at      five-eighth and Simonds at full-back?     <p>     Will speedy teenagers Rod Jensen and Matt Daylight hold their wing      spots outside the settled centre combination of David Kidwell and      Peter Clarke?      <p>     Or will successful blockbusting flanker Joe Tamani be back in the      starting lineup?     <p>     Big hitting RAMS forward Mark Corvo, who had an excellent game from      the bench against the SHARKS, is out serving the last week of his two      week suspension.     <p>     Why did Rod Reddy prefer to start Kerrod Walters, crowd favourite at      Adelaide Oval, from the bench?     <p>     Is it because Walters uses up too many attacking plays by running from      dummy half and getting caught at the ruck by one of the markers?     <p>     Maybe Kerrod should use this move more sparingly, say for the first or      second tackle play inside the opposition's quarter where it will have      more points return for the surprise value?     <p>     Dean Schifilliti has done little wrong in the dummy-half role this      season and, like Walters, he has featured in general play.       Schifilliti's backing up of RAMS linebreakers justifies his presence      in the starting thirteen along with Walters.     <p>     The keys to Adelaide beating Canberra are extra-ordinarily simple.      <p>     FIRST, Adelaide must eliminate unforced errors when in possession in      their own half.  No more stupid passes or running close to touch or      silly penalties inside their own thirty metres.     <p>     North Queensland, Gold Coast and Cronulla won close matches on such      mistakes by Adelaide.       <p>     SECOND, and this will be the critical issue, the RAMS pack must get on      top of the RAIDERS forwards.  This will give Goldthorpe time to get      his passing and kicking game working most effectively and create more      options for Adelaide's outside backs.     <p>     Rolling back the Canberra forwards is going to require big efforts      from Alan Cann, Andrew Hick and Darien Doherty.  From what this trio      have displayed at Adelaide Oval this season, they're up to the job.     <p>     THIRD, the RAMS three-quarters must stay alert and put in good chases      after Goldthorpe's kicks.  They did this very well against the fast      and polished Cronulla backs.     <p>     FOURTH, and this is so basic that it seems silly to have to spell it      out, the RAMS must concentrate and move up in defence for 80 minutes.       This was the best feature of their game in 1997.     <p>     So far the RAMS have been consistently beaten because they take too      many high risk options with the ball in their own quarter ... a      tendency to play "catch up" football when it's not needed.       <p>     This is a tell-tale sign of lack of confidence ... either in team      mates or in the game plan.     <p>     Adelaide can become consistently competitive by executing a game plan      that all players understand and can complete.     <p>     The lineup will then become settled, cohesion will develop and      confidence will increase.     <p>     Adelaide's other major problem is their appalling away record this      season.       <p>     The RAMS have scored 50 and conceded 76 points in four matches at      Adelaide Oval this year, an average difference of 6 and a half points      in favour of their opponents.       <p>     In four away games, Adelaide have scored 34 and conceded a whopping      156, an average losing margin of 30 and a half points!     <p>     This is a very serious problem.     <p>     Is Dean Lance the solution?       <p>     Insipid defensive performances in Sydney have seen Adelaide tagged      "the hapless Rams" in the eastern press.       <p>     The RAMS players have a chance on Friday night to start to change this      perception of themselves by beating Canberra.     <p>     With successive games against Canberra (round 9 at home), Parramatta      (10 away), Penrith (11 home), Wests (12 away) and St. George (13      home), the RAMS do not play a team that is currently in the top six      for five weeks.  They complete their June assignments by meeting      Melbourne (round 14 at Olympic Park), Illawarra (15 at home) and Gold      Coast (16 away).     <p>     May and June could be the easiest section of the RAMS regular      home-and-away series.     <p>     With the possible exception of St George, the RAMS next four fixtures      at Adelaide Oval are against opponents who are struggling for      consistency.     <p>     The RAMS have an great opportunity to take control over their season.     <p>     If they don't do so very soon, Adelaide is likely to conclude the      season as pre-finals training fodder in the last four rounds when they      are scheduled to run a daunting gauntlet of championship contenders.     <p>     In August the Adelaide RAMS face in succession the Brisbane BRONCOS      (21 away), the Manly SEA EAGLES (22 home), the North Sydney BEARS (23      home) and the Newcastle KNIGHTS (24 away).     <p>     No one wants to see Adelaide suffer a month of hidings in the lead up      to the playoffs.     <p>     The Round 22 clash with the SEA EAGLES promises to produce the biggest      Adelaide Oval crowd of the season.  (Top drawcards, the BRONCOS and      the KNIGHTS, don't appear in Adelaide in 1998.  Aside from Manly, the      Canberra RAIDERS and the St. George DRAGONS, June 6/7, appear to be      the biggest drawcards to face the RAMS at home this year.)     <p>     A series of RAM victories against moderate opposition in May and June      would give the players the confidence to play the role of wild card      pre-playoff giant killers in August.     <p>     Think of what that will do for player contract negotiations and      sponsor interest!     <p>     Not to mention what a reward this would be from the Adelaide Rugby      League Football Club to the 7,000 to 8,000 South Australians who      regularly give up time and money to be insulted by the pre-match      hyperbole and to be disappointed by yet another RAMS defeat "snatched      from the jaws of victory" at Adelaide Oval.     <p>     Am I dreaming?     <p>     I'll find out at the centreline on Friday night when near-rookie coach      Mal Meninga brings the inconsistent RAIDERS across from Canberra,      fresh from a comfortable win against Balmain, to collect what they      think are their two "free" NRL competition points. <p><center><hr noshade><A HREF="http://www.electric.on.net"        onMouseOver="waxon('home');        statuson('home'); return true;"        onMouseOut="statusoff(); waxoff('home');        return true;"><IMG name=home SRC="../buttons/butt_home_off.gif" ALT="home" WIDTH="140" HEIGHT="32" BORDER="0"></a><A HREF="../sport/index.html"        onMouseOver="waxon('sport');        statuson('sport'); return true;"        onMouseOut="statusoff(); waxoff('sport');        return true;"><IMG name=sport SRC="../buttons/butt_sport_off.gif" ALT="sport" WIDTH="140" HEIGHT="32" BORDER="0"></a><hr noshade></center><p><A HREF="http://www.electric.on.net">http://www.electric.on.net</A><p>&copy; This work is subject to copyright.
