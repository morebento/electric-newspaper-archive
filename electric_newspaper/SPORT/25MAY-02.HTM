Congratulations to Lavilla - he rode a great race."<p>The early morning saw driving rain. Morning warm-up was delayed while trackstaff tried to clear standing water in some of the corners. In a departurefrom the norm, theriders were allowed three sighting laps prior to the race, and  race wasshortened from 26 to 20 laps. <p>Championship leader Haga led the pack away ahead of Lavilla and Honda's ColinEdwards. However the lead was short-lived, and Haga dropped to 8th, leavingKawasaki's Neil Hodgson leading Edwards and ex-125 GP champion Gramigni, ona Ducati.<p>By lap 4, Lavilla had used his local knowledge (and greater courage) togood            effect - he took the lead and started to make the break,leading Edwards, Troy            Corser, Aaron Slight and Chili to battleas the rain still continued. However Chili           was on a charge, andfive laps later had passed everyone except the Spaniard        and wasclosing at a rate of 0.8 seconds per lap.<p>At just over half distance, Chili had closed down Lavilla and in factappeared to  be waved by. Behind them, Troy Corser had managed to get intothird and set about chasing the leading pair, while the two Hondas,Hodgson's Kawasaki and fast Yamaha-mounted Scott Russell battled for theremaining places.<p>"I  think we made the right tyre choice here," said a confident Russell."Colin went for a softer compound while we chose the hard version and itlasted better as the race went on. As I passed Hodgson and Colin the bikemust have sucked in some water and started to run on three cylinders, so Iwaved them past. Then two laps later it cleared again so I came back. I'llbe on the podium for sure in race 2."<p>Chili was clear and away by the end of the race, and Corser forced his wayintosecond on the last lap to make it a factory 1-2 for Ducati and a fullpodium for the Italian manufacturer.<p><pre>                  Race 1 result                  POS RIDER BIKE                  TIME    GAP                  1.

The CastrolHondas failed to make it out for the sighting lap, but made it to the gridfor the start. <p>As the lights went green, Fogarty was first away and led into the first bend.<p>Behind him there was mayhem as Yanagawa went in hot under Lavilla and then     lifted the bike up, forcing Lavilla into the rear of Hodgson andcausing Whitham and Edwards to run off the track. As all four bikes wentout, Whitham was able to get back on the track and fought his way back into10th by the end. Hodgson was less lucky, but still managed to nurse adamaged bike to 14th, while unluckiest of all both Lavilla and Edwardsfailed to restart as both machines were too damaged to continue.<p>Up front, it was Yamaha's Noriyuki Haga who yet again showed a dazzlingdisplay of lurid slides and exciting style to try and keep up with a smoothand confident Fogarty. Eventually his tyres gave up the struggle, and asthe race progressed he fell backwards into the grasp of first Aaron Slightand then Troy Corser.<p>In a spread-out race, it was left to Fogarty to come home a comfortable 6seconds ahead of the rest.<p>After the race, Fogarty was in a bouyant but philisophical mood. "The way Irode in the first race I needed sacking, so I needed to do something! Ifelt confident all weekend but I needed the weather to be good to provemyself. It's important to get a good start here and then I just got my headdown and felt in control really - it was good. I just need to get it rightfor both races; I seem to be doing one good and and bad all season at themoment."<p>Fogarty has now moved into second position in the championship behind new       leader Corser.       <p><pre>                  Race 2 Results                  POS RIDER BIKE                  TIME    GAP                  1.
