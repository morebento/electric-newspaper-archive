His drive also helped bring               Ferrari to within three points of McLaren in the chase for               constructors honours.               <p>               The start was given on a damp track with high winds blowing               from behind the cars down the pit straight so the entire field               opted to start on intermediate tyres. Hakkinen got away               cleanly from pole to lead Michael Schumacher. The big               surprise at the start came from Jean Alesi who went from 8th               to 4th to tuck in behind Coulthard in the second McLaren.               Eddie Irvine had a very bad start, dropping from 5 to 10 but               he moved up to 8 on lap 4. Meanwhile, Schumacher's Ferrari               appeared to be closing on the leader but Coulthard chanced               a heroic move on the Ferrari and took second place at               Abbey corner. Ralf Schumacher, who had to start from the               back row, passed five cars at the start and was 13th at this               stage. On lap 7, Irvine got past Hill for 7th place; it was               difficult as the Jordan driver indulged in some dubious               weaving manoeuvres. Then conditions worsened as it started               to drizzle. On a charge, Irvine now dispensed with               Villeneuve's Williams to move into the top six. Schumi Junior               was obviously smarting at his qualifying penalty and was now               poking his nose alongside Fisichella as he tried to take 11th               place off the Benetton. On a damp track it was exciting stuff.               Irvine was also fun to watch, getting rid of Frentzen for fifth               place on lap 11.               <p>               One lap later, Michael Schumacher set a fastest lap and               began to close on Coulthard. Ralf Schumacher was the first               to pit for fresh tyres on lap 13. There was a huge sigh of               disappointment from the British fans when Damon Hill spun               out of the race one lap later. The rain and wind came down               with a vengeance in the pit area at this point and at the back               of the circuit two laps later. Frentzen's race was over on lap               15 after a spin. The rain meant unscheduled pit stops to fit               wets, Fisichella and Barrichello being the first to do so and               Michael Schumacher fitted new intermediates on lap 19               dropping him to fifth behind team-mate Irvine. Coulthard               pitted on lap 21 and Alesi and Irvine on 22. Brilliant work               from the Ferrari crew saw the Irish driver exit the pits just               ahead of Alesi's Sauber to move up a slot. He made another               move to take fourth away from Herbert.The leader now               pitted and at just over the third distance the order was;               Hakkinen, Coulthard, Schumacher, Irvine, Herbert, Alesi.               Only 11 cars were on the same lap as the leader.                British hopes were further dashed on lap 27 when Herbert               was caught out by the conditions and spun off going into               Luffield and a close following Alesi almost wiped out the               entire Sauber effort. Amazingly, Ralf Schumacher was now in               sixth! Salo's Arows missed the target on lap 29 as he spun off               coming into the pit straight. He had been 12th. The gap               between the two leading McLarens was fluctuating around               the two second mark as they fought their way through the               traffic. Tuero and Rosset's lonely race at the back ended on               lap 32 when they spun off together.               <p>               Lap 37 is one David Coulthard will remember for a long time,               when he lost it at Brooklands, trying to lap Fisichella, ending               a nightmare weekend for the Scot.                <p>               The rain was much heavier now and Irvine made his second               stop on lap 39 and Hakkinen and Schumacher followed one               lap later, the German making up a second on the McLaren in               the pits. In the atrocious conditions, there were several               spinners, Wurz even managing to swop ends at the entrance               to the pit lane. On lap 42 Hakkinen acquaplaned off at               incredibly high speed at Bridge, but even more incredibly, he               ended up back on the track and pointing in the right direction.				<p>               When there were only 2 laps to go before three quarter               distance (45 laps), the Safety Car was brought out. After five               laps the race was on again. The rain had stopped but the               track was still a river and while Hakkinen got away cleanly,               Schumacher had to deal with Fisichella (ahead on the track               but one lap down) before setting off in pursuit of the sole               remaining McLaren. On lap 51, Hakkinen cracked under               pressure, went off at Becketts and the Ferrari was in the lead.               The Finn had an excuse as his aerodynamics had suffered as               a result of his earlier spin. Villeneuve was also a spinner				in the               late stages while third placed Irvine was beginning to threaten               Hakkinen. Alesi's best performance of the season came to               end when he lost fourth place with an electrical fault in the               gearbox. Irvine got to within less than a second of the               McLaren but with three laps to go he eased off and settled               for third after his car began to lose grip and traction. The               Benetton boys were next up with Wurz fourth and Fisichella               fifth, while Ralf made it a great day for the Schumi brothers,               scoring his and Jordan's first point of the season.               Confusion reigned on the last lap when it was obvious Ferrari               were getting ready for a pit-stop. Schumacher had apparently               overtaken someone when a yellow flag was being shown.               The official handed the team the Stewards decision but it was               not clear whether 10 seconds would be added to               Schumacher'e time or whether he actually had to come in for               a stop-go penalty, which would take much longer than the               actual ten seconds. The team decided to play it safe and call               him in on the very last lap, which was within the permitted               period of three laps from notification of the offence. He won               the race, effectively taking the chequered flag in the			   pit-lane. 			   <p>               But McLaren protested this decision.     <br clear=all><p><center><hr noshade><A HREF="http://www.electric.on.net"        onMouseOver="waxon('home');        statuson('home'); return true;"        onMouseOut="statusoff(); waxoff('home');        return true;"><IMG name=home SRC="../buttons/butt_home_off.gif" ALT="home" WIDTH="140" HEIGHT="32" BORDER="0"></a><A HREF="../sport/index.html"        onMouseOver="waxon('sport');        statuson('sport'); return true;"        onMouseOut="statusoff(); waxoff('sport');        return true;"><IMG name=sport SRC="../buttons/butt_sport_off.gif" ALT="sport" WIDTH="140" HEIGHT="32" BORDER="0"></a><hr noshade></center><p><A HREF="http://www.electric.on.net">http://www.electric.on.net</A><p>&copy; This work is subject to copyright.
