Adelaide and North Queensland were awarded two tries each as thevisitors went down by 14-10.<p>This was a tough call, in many ways.<p>You can sense the pressure to get one of the top ten spots and a chance tocompete in the playoffs is foremost in the player's minds from a glance atthe scorecards for round 19.  <p>The North Sydney Bears 34-10 drubbed Melbourne Storm in a top ten clash andSt George just failed to threaten Newcastle.  Most of the other tussleswere close run affairs between clubs close to each other on the premiershiptable below the “top six”.<p>And another flogging of Souths and Wests.<p>Sydney clubs have serious problems.  Unfortunately, their managements havebeen slower than most to recognise the changes in the external environmentthat have occurred that affect sport in general, if not rugby league inparticular.<p>Managers, coaches and players are aware that in six weeks time the seasonwill abruptly reduce from ten games a week to four when the business end ofthe season gets underway.<p>The number of games per weekend will thereafter rapidly nose dive as theten teams that finish in the top half of the twenty team comp play off forthe right to a capture a unique trophy.<p>The inaugural NRL championship might be a very nice start to a bright new1999.<p>Reputations are on the line, contracts are under review and the future isat stake.<p>Not to mention the commitment of sponsors! <p>Exposure in the playoffs is the minimum expectation of most of those payingthe bills.  Finals exposure is the holy grail for all involved.<p>Well ... it's time.<p>Following on the heels of the cliffhangers between Auckland and Balmain(21-20) and between Parramatta and Canterbury (7-6) and the 14-all drawbetween Cronulla and Penrith, the Cowboys and the Rams added further totheir two-year history of close matches.  <p>The result, as usual for these protagonists, was frustrating for the Rams.<p>The rain, wind, travel and referee proved too much for the visitors fromAdelaide.<p>It's now arithmetically safe to discuss the Rams playoff prospects.  TheCowboys have ended the dream.<p>The teams, as usual, were evenly matched.  This isn't much of a surprise.  <p>Rams' coach, Dean Lance, played under North Queensland coach Tim Sheenswhen they were both in Canberra.<p>Adelaide Rams captain and hooker, Kerrod Walters, was matched up againsthis brother Steve, hooker for the Cowboys.<p>You'd imagine these fellahs would have little difficulty figuring out whatthe other guys will do next.<p>Wind and rain have dogged Adelaide's confrontations with North Queensland.<p>On Saturday night, the conditions were primarily responsible for the Ram'sGraham Appo's inability to kick the goals needed to give Adelaide four winsin a row.<p>The electric Ram's centre speedster is a very accurate but relativelyinexperienced goal kicker.  His kicking strength was tested by the heavyand slippery ball.<p>The Ram's crossed their opponents tryline twice in the last quarter of playbut were denied by referee Steve Chiddy on both occasions.<p>The Rams are reported to have lodged an official complaint to the NRL aboutthe referee's decisions.<p>But, with so many games each weekend, and the poor capacity of the Rams andthe Cowboys to draw audiences on television in Sydney and Brisbane, therewas no video referee on hand to assist.<p>In other matches, the Dragons showed that discussions between St George andthe Illawarra Steelers to amalgamate and form the St George Steel Dragonsin 1999, have not dimmed their undoubted ability to be effective in thefinals.<p>Saints were down 28-12 midway through the second half of their match withARL premiers Newcastle but produced incredible counter-attack to get withina major score of stealing an impossible win.  The Knights shakily hung onto win 28-22.<p>Sydney City obliterated Wests 62-4 in an embarrassment to the league.<p>See you at Hindmarsh stadium next Saturday afternoon when the Rams show theWarriors just how hard it can be to beat Adelaide at home.     <br clear=all><p><center><hr noshade><A HREF="http://www.electric.on.net"        onMouseOver="waxon('home');        statuson('home'); return true;"        onMouseOut="statusoff(); waxoff('home');        return true;"><IMG name=home SRC="../buttons/butt_home_off.gif" ALT="home" WIDTH="140" HEIGHT="32" BORDER="0"></a><A HREF="../sport/index.html"        onMouseOver="waxon('sport');        statuson('sport'); return true;"        onMouseOut="statusoff(); waxoff('sport');        return true;"><IMG name=sport SRC="../buttons/butt_sport_off.gif" ALT="sport" WIDTH="140" HEIGHT="32" BORDER="0"></a><hr noshade></center><p><A HREF="http://www.electric.on.net">http://www.electric.on.net</A><p>&copy; This work is subject to copyright.
