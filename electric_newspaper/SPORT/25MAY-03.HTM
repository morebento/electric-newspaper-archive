Mika Hakkinen (McLaren-Mercedes), 1hr 51:23.595s;2. Giancarlo Fisichella (Benetton-Playlife), 11.47 seconds behind; 3. Eddie Irvine (Ferrari), 41.38 seconds behind. </pre><p>Q.Congratulations, Mika, on being the first Mercedes driver to win heresince 1938!This has been a fantastic weekend for you. <p>MH: Yes, I don't think it will be until later today, or maybe tomorrow,that I will realise exactlyhow important it will be for me that I have won this race. Winning at MonteCarlo is the dream ofmost Grand Prix drivers, and now it's happened to me. It's so special thatit's hard to believe thatit's happened to me yet. I never could have done this alone. There are somany people on theteam, my close friends, who have been able to make this happen today. <p>Q. David was following you quite closely in the early laps. When heretired, were youworried that the same thing might happen to your car? <p>MH: Yes, you worry automatically during a race, particularly when you arein the lead. Eventhough everything feels fantastic, you start to worry about the tyres, theengine, everything -- andyou wonder if it's going to be reliable to the end. Quite early during thisrace I had an incident atthe exit of Rascasse when I clipped an inside kerb. I was quite worriedthat I might havedamaged something in the rear suspension. It is thanks to the boys who wokeup up early in themorning and built the nice strong suspension for us which was able to takea little bump like that.They did a great job. <p>Q. You made just one pit stop, on lap 29. Was that the strategy which youplannedbefore the race? <p>MH: Everything went according to plan. The team called me in and everythingwas pretty cool. Iunderstood at the time there were no problems. <p>Q. Giancarlo, you must be delighted. After your second place in Belgiumlast year, isthis even more special? <p>GF: It is a great result for me. My target was to get on the podium, sothird place would havebeen fantastic, but to be in second place in unbelievable. I like thiscircuit a lot and I won here inFormula 3 [on 1994] -- and now I have a second place in F1. <p>Q. Like Mika, you also had a moment at the Rascasse which cost you a spinand almost15 seconds. What happened there? <p>GF: I touched the kerb on the inside of the Rascasse corner and spun.Fortunately there was stillquite a big gap between me and Eddie, so I was very lucky. <p>Q. Eddie, congratulations on another fine Monaco result. You finished thirdhere lastyear, and this is is your third podium finish of the season. Was it a hardrace for you? <p>EI: It was hard at the start. I was behind Frentzen, who I knew was on thesoft tyres, so Idecided I had to get past him. I dived down inside him at the hairpin andwe made a bit ofcontact. But I managed to keep going -- and Heinz didn't, for a change!Once I had got past himit was a pretty lonely race for me. I couldn't make any headway on theBenettons. We had a lotof fuel on board at the start of the race, so I left the pit stop reallylate. I am pleased to havefinished third, but I am a bit disappointed by the overall performance. <p>Q. When you clashed wheels with Frentzen were you worried about thepossibility ofdamage to your car? <p>EI: Yes, because I have to say that we hit each other reasonably hard. Butimmediately throughthe first two corners after the incident the car felt as though there wereno problems with it. Afterthat I was confident that nothing [serious] had happened to it. <p>Q. Ferrari made some changes to the car for this race. Are you moreconfident aboutyour chances for the next race, in Canada, or is your situation worse than youexpected? <p>EI: Well, I thought coming here would be better [than it was]. Bridgestoneseemed to have had agood softer tyre. But it didn't seem to work out that way. Our soft tyrewas a bit too softer andthe harder one wasn't quick enough for a good qualifying time. But I didsome testing atMagny-Cours last week and we came up with some new tyres for Canada. I amhoping thatMontreal will be a different story. <p><center><hr noshade><A HREF="http://www.electric.on.net"        onMouseOver="waxon('home');        statuson('home'); return true;"        onMouseOut="statusoff(); waxoff('home');        return true;"><IMG name=home SRC="../buttons/butt_home_off.gif" ALT="home" WIDTH="140" HEIGHT="32" BORDER="0"></a><A HREF="../sport/index.html"        onMouseOver="waxon('sport');        statuson('sport'); return true;"        onMouseOut="statusoff(); waxoff('sport');        return true;"><IMG name=sport SRC="../buttons/butt_sport_off.gif" ALT="sport" WIDTH="140" HEIGHT="32" BORDER="0"></a><hr noshade></center><p><A HREF="http://www.electric.on.net">http://www.electric.on.net</A><p>&copy; This work is subject to copyright.
