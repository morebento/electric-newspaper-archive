His victory at the German Grand Prix was a convincing as the Australian got an excellent start from the third slot on the front row.<p> Brazilian Alex Barros (Gresini Honda), starting from the second row and back in fifth at the end of the first lap barged his way past KennyRoberts Jr. (Team Roberts Modenas), Simon Crafar (Red Bull Yamaha) and Biaggi and finally got past Doohan into the lead on lap five. Barros put up thefastest lap of the race on lap three but once in front his lap times rose. He hung onuntil lap eight until Doohan came back past and stepped up the pace to pull out a lead that would eventually grow to over three seconds.<p> Barros, Crafar and Roberts saw Doohan starting to pull away, but couldn‚t get past the late braking Brazilian until Crafar, the surprise winner at Donington Park two weeks ago at the British Grand Prix, finally made a found his way through on lap eleven. Once in second place and with clear road in front, Crafar felt that he could pull back the lead that Doohan had taken.<p> "I thought that I could run at Doohan‚s pace, but I guess I was wrong because I crashed trying to keep up,"said the rider from New Zealand. Biaggi had made several attempts to get past Barros and Crafar, but on two occasions he ran wide and lost ground. When he finally took over second place after Crafar‚s crash, Doohan had already pulled a comfortable +2 second lead.<p> Biaggi, who started from the pole, worked to match Doohan‚s pace and on lap 23 he managed to reduce Doohan‚s lead from 3.7 to 3.3 seconds. On the next lap the Italian took back another .2 of a second, but Doohan, seeing the gap reduced on his pit board, pushed himself to equal Biaggi‚s pace and then began to rebuild his lead until the final three laps when, with a safe 3 second lead in hand, he was able to ease the pace and coast home to a strong win at a track that he didn‚t like.<p> Kenny Roberts Jr., riding the original version of the Modenas KR3 probably for the last time (the new bike is expected to debut in the Czech Republic) gradually slipped back from the leading group and was eventually sixth, the best ever result for the Malaysian-funded machine. <p> Alex Crivillé (Repsol Honda)paid the consequences of a poor start on a track where overtaking is very difficult. He came from eighth at the end of thefirst lap to third, but was pushed all the way to the finish by Barros, who was fourth. Crivillé, who had team mate Sete Gibernau on the Repsol Honda twin in tow, caught and passed Roberts on lap 17 but Roberts fought hard to hold off his former team mate from the Spanish 250 championship. <p> Gibernau got by on lap 23 but on the next lap his works Honda began to chunk the rear tire and he was forced to retire on the next to last lap when he had dropped to next to last.<p> Regis Laconi, who got a poor start from the front row, took fifth fromRoberts on lap 17 and then pulled away to finish fifth. <p> Doohan seemed relaxed after his 31 laps under the summer sun of Germany. "I‚m not really knackered because it isn‚t really that hard to race around here. The speeds are slow and you are spending a lot of time just waiting to get a chance to open the throttle. I think it was ridiculous to shorten this race by two laps. If we can ride 31 laps we can ride 33."<p> Sitting at the Post Race Press Conference alongside Max Biaggi, he added, "I want to add that, like Max always says, this is a race track where I had no practice and no data so it was as new to me as to everyone else. I got a good start, but the bike was a little hard to ride when the tank was full. Barros passed me and I saw that once in front his pace dropped off and everybody was starting to catch us, so I made my move and tried to make a break. I was able to do it and once in front I just kept it steady. With afew laps to go I saw that Max was starting to take back a bit and that my lead had come down from three and a half seconds to about three seconds. I made another push and was able to take back the time Max had gained. At the end I was able to let off a little."<p> Max Biaggi said, "Early in the race Barros and Crafar overtook me and then I lost a lot of time trying to get back past. When I finally got into second Mick had a very big lead and I could not catch him."<p> Third place finisher Alex Criville dedicated his podium to his injured fellow countryman Carlos Checa who is out of hospital and recovering from his Donington Park crash. "I am pleased to be in the top three after my poor results in the last two races, but I need to get back in touch with the leaders.     <br clear=all><p><center><hr noshade><A HREF="http://www.electric.on.net"        onMouseOver="waxon('home');        statuson('home'); return true;"        onMouseOut="statusoff(); waxoff('home');        return true;"><IMG name=home SRC="../buttons/butt_home_off.gif" ALT="home" WIDTH="140" HEIGHT="32" BORDER="0"></a><A HREF="../sport/index.html"        onMouseOver="waxon('sport');        statuson('sport'); return true;"        onMouseOut="statusoff(); waxoff('sport');        return true;"><IMG name=sport SRC="../buttons/butt_sport_off.gif" ALT="sport" WIDTH="140" HEIGHT="32" BORDER="0"></a><hr noshade></center><p><A HREF="http://www.electric.on.net">http://www.electric.on.net</A><p>&copy; This work is subject to copyright.
