"If I could put my finger on it, I'd have done itearlier in mycareer. It's just not that easy."<p>On a day of heroics and miracle shots, when Birkdale demanded a little morethan 72 holes of even par, O'Meara drew from his steely nerves to becomethe first player since Nick Faldo in 1990 to win the Masters and theBritish Open in the same year.<p>"I use past experience to my advantage," said O'Meara, who closed with a2-under 68 and beat Watts by two strokes in the four-hole playoff. "Eventhough I'm nervous, more times than not I've been able to finish off thedeal."<p>At 41, O'Meara became the oldest player to win two majors in the same year.Jack Nicklaus (1980), Ben Hogan (1953) and Craig Wood (1941) were all 40when they won two majors.<p>O'Meara and Watts, a 32-year-old Oklahoman who plays on the Japanese tour,both finished at 280, the first time even par has won the Open since GregNorman in 1986 at Turnberry.<p>Woods roared from behind with birdies on three of the last four holes andnarrowly missed the playoff. He closed with a 66, tied with Scotland'sRaymond Russell for the best round of the day, to finish at 281.<p>Russell, Jim Furyk, Jesper Parnevik and the 17-year-old amateur Justin Roseof England were at 282.<p>"Of all the championships in the world, this in my opinion is the mostspecial," O'Meara said.<p>He won it with the steady play that has marked his career, in the face ofone dramatic finish after another on a breezy day at Birkdale.<p>First came Woods, pumping his fist in rapid-fire succession with each ofhis three birdies over the final four holes. Needing a birdie on No. 18 totie for the lead at 1 over, he rammed home a 30-footer and let out a roar.<p>"Unfortunately, it wasn't good enough," Woods said after his best finish ina major since he won the Masters last year.<p>Then came Rose, his innocent smile as sweet as his name implies. Imperviousto the pressure of being an amateur mixing it up with best in the world, heholed awedge on No. 18 from 45 yards away in the nasty rough for a 69 that put himat 2-over 282.<p>He raised his hands and smiled into the heavens, soaking in a performancethat captivated a country. <p>"To finish like that was unexplainable," said Rose, who posted the highestfinish in the Open by an amateur since Frank Stranahan tied for second fourstrokes behind Hogan at Carnoustie in 1953.<p>"It's just one of those magic moments."<p>But there was one more piece of magic left at Birkdale.<p>O'Meara broke the 1-over tie with Woods by making a 15-foot birdie putt onthe 17th. One group behind, Watts dropped a 12-footer for birdie to join him.<p>But Watts' drive on the 18th found the clumpy rough left of the fairway,and his approach took one last hop into the bunker, stopping on thedown-slope of thesand -- no guarantee he would even be able to knock it on the green.<p>Digging in the sand with his left foot, his right foot flexed at an angleon the grass above, Watts took the club back twice, hovered over the balland then blasted out.<p>With O'Meara watching from behind the green, the ball hopped slightly tothe right and rolled to within a foot of the cup for a tap-in par, settingthe table for even more drama.<p>The playoff was the first since John Daly beat Costantino Rocca at St.Andrews in 1995 to begin a four-year stretch of American dominance acrossthe Atlantic.<p>On the way to the 15th hole to start the playoff, O'Meara's caddie, JerryHigginbotham, turned to him and said, "Just pretend you've got Tiger outfor an emergency nine."<p>O'Meara routinely wins practice rounds against Woods, who lives in priceyIsleworth along with Els and Lee Janzen, both two-time U.S. Open champions.<p>Watts, however, wasn't up to the task.<p>He missed a 3-foot birdie putt on the par-5 15th, missed another birdieputt from 12 feet on the next hole and only stayed in the game by savingpar on the 17th with a 10-foot putt.<p>O'Meara never wavered, expressionless as he walked down the fairway --always a safe place to be at Birkdale. He birdied the 15th from 5 feet andmade two-putt pars the rest of the way.<p>Watts' last hope was to hole a bunker shot at No. 18, but he shook his headas soon as the ball emerged from a splash of sand and scurried 20 feet pastthe hole.<p>Watts two-putted for bogey, his first on any of the last six holes over thefour rounds of the tournament.<p>"I knew I had to hole the bunker shot to have any chance," Watts said. "Ifyou would have told me at the beginning of this week that I'd be inposition to win the Open championship, I wouldn't have believed you.<p>"I'm still proud of myself."     <br clear=all><p><center><hr noshade><A HREF="http://www.electric.on.net"        onMouseOver="waxon('home');        statuson('home'); return true;"        onMouseOut="statusoff(); waxoff('home');        return true;"><IMG name=home SRC="../buttons/butt_home_off.gif" ALT="home" WIDTH="140" HEIGHT="32" BORDER="0"></a><A HREF="../sport/index.html"        onMouseOver="waxon('sport');        statuson('sport'); return true;"        onMouseOut="statusoff(); waxoff('sport');        return true;"><IMG name=sport SRC="../buttons/butt_sport_off.gif" ALT="sport" WIDTH="140" HEIGHT="32" BORDER="0"></a><hr noshade></center><p><A HREF="http://www.electric.on.net">http://www.electric.on.net</A><p>&copy; This work is subject to copyright.
