What a finish!<p>     In the final minute of the rugby league State of Origin No. 1,     Queensland produced a miracle 90 metre two-play try scored by     interchange player Tony Carroll to silence the Sydney Football Stadium     crowd of 36,000 who were already celebrating a New South Wales     victory.<p>     When the full-time siren sounded, Qld were behind 22-23 on the     scoreboard with the try conversion kick to come.  From about 15 metres     to the right of the posts, fullback Darren Lockyer calmly booted the     place kick through the slot and over the bar.<p>     Queensland had won the first State of Origin match 24-23 in the three     match 1998 series.<p>     What an incredible game!<p>     The Maroons started well from the opening kickoff by the Blues.  After     both teams had completed two full sets of possession, NSW had been     driven back about 40 metres.<p>     Both teams showed skill, class and intensity right from the start.     And, typical of origin rugby league, the pace was furious.<p>     There were no errors, fumbles, knock-ons, air passes, missed tackles     or penalties for the first six minutes.<p>     The Blues were the first to be forced into double error.<p>     A dropped ball and a penalty put Queensland deep inside New South     Wales territory.  After several probes at the impregnable Blue     defence, Queensland halfback and captain Alan Langer set up the first     try.<p>     Alfie ran across the defence to his right and kicked a reverse     grubber.  The cross-angled kick bounced off a Blue leg, rolled and     bounced into the NSW in goal area, where a diving Kevin Walters     touched down near the right goalpost.  Fullback Lockyer added the     extra two points, and after seven minutes it was Queensland 6 New     South Wales 0.<p>     It was all Queensland for the next ten minutes.<p>     In the middle of this period came one of three critical plays in the     game.  The most important play was of course the match-deciding last     minute.  Another occurred about 15 minutes from the end of the second     half, when the injured and exhausted New South Wales defence     successfully repelled an unrelenting Queensland onslaught and hit back     with a length of the field try.<p>     But in the 11th minute of the first half, silly play by Maroons left     winger Mat Sing cost Queensland a certain six points.<p>     With Steve Renouf carrying the ball in the clear, ahead of the defence     and 25 metres from the crossbar, Sing ran to his right and collided     with pursuing NSW centre Terry Hill, taking him out of the play.<p>     It was totally unnecessary.  No one in the world was going to run down     Renouf.<p>     Acting on the report of a touch judge, referee Halligan, who did an     excellent job overall, correctly declared "no try" and awarded NSW a     relieving penalty.<p>     This lucky let-off inspired the Blue forwards into action.  They     proceeded to completely dominate the rest of the first half.  The     inexperience and lesser strength of the Qld forwards was exploited     leading to three unanswered tries to New South Wales before half-time.<p>     In this period, the NSW forwards smashed their opponents in attack and     defence.<p>     The first to capitalise on their forward domination were NSW captain     and five-eighth, Laurie Daley and fullback Tim Brasher.<p>     Brasher ran at an emerging a gap just wide of the ruck and Daley,     dragging the defence to his left by running left threw a beautifully     timed reverse pass and Brasher was through.  The former, and possibly     future, Australian fullback then outpaced the cover defence to score     an excellent try.<p>     Blues halfback Andrew Johns failed with the relatively straightforward     conversion kick, just shading the uprights.<p>     This became a pattern and, in the end, turned out to be New South     Wales' weakness.<p>     Qld 6 NSW 4<p>     With some space and some time with the ball in his hands, courtesy of     the dominance of Paul Harragon, Dean Pay, Rod Howe and Nick Kosef near     the ruck and at the advantage line, Johns got his general kicking game     in order and started doing what everyone predicted.<p>     He bombed the hell out of the Maroon's wingers and fullback.  The     Blues three-quarters supported him well with great chases.<p>     And, eventually, as everyone predicted, the Maroons backs erred.<p>     The first came from Lockyer, but the chase gave him no room.  He leapt     into the air for the ball but hit two NSW players doing the same thing     and propelled the ball forward, about 2 metres from his own line.     Daley showed amazing ball juggling skills and agility to scoop up and     secure the ball and bounce over for a four pointer.<p>     Johns narrowly failed to kick the conversion from out wide.<p>     NSW 8 Qld 6<p>     A few minutes later, Queensland right winger Wendell Sailor fumbled a     high ball with veteran NSW centre Andrew Ettinghausen right in his     face.<p>     From the ten metre scrum, Daley ran, slowed, stood the defence up and     hit the speeding Brasher right on the chest with an excellent pass.     The NSW fullback, making the extra man in attack, drew the last of the     defence and gave right winger Rod Wishart a clear run to the line.<p>     Johns again very narrowly failed to convert from out wide.<p>     NSW 12 Qld 6<p>     A few minutes before half time, Andrew Johns finally scored points     from a kick, scoring 1 point from a field goal from about 35 metres     out.<p>     At half time, NSW led Qld by 13-6.<p>     The Blues performance in the last 25 minutes of the first half was     very impressive, but there were some danger signs.<p>     Daley, who was having an absolute blinder, limped off a few minutes     early with what seemed to be a calf problem.<p>     Harragon, who had been very effective in attack and defence, and had     been spelled to the interchange bench a couple of times, also went off     early, reportedly for attention to his persistent back injury.<p>     Queensland coach Wayne Bennet may have recognised this, because the     Queensland forwards started on fire in the second half, led by     debutant Martin Lang from the interchange bench.  Bartrim and Larson     also tore out some valuable yards at the ruck.<p>     Within 15 minutes, Queensland scored two converted tries from grubber     kicks behind the New South Wales defensive line inside their ten metre     line.  These kicks were both from the little master himself, Alfie.     Langer scored one of these and Steve Price scored the other.<p>     Suddenly the Blues were staring at up at a 13-18 scoreline.<p>     It was now or never.<p>     In a desperate series of "keep the ball alive" passes, NSW finally ran     the Maroon defence silly and lock Brad Fittler speared through from 15     metres out to touch down.<p>     Johns again very narrowly failed to convert.<p>     Qld 18 NSW 17<p>     With less than 15 minutes remaining Queensland desperately tried to     put NSW away.  They threw everything at the injured and tiring Blue     defence.  Renouf and Smith both came within less than half a metre of     scoring tries.<p>     Then came the dramatic and exciting last eight minutes.<p>     Wishart comfortably fielded a Kevin Walters kick a couple of metres     out from his line, stepped inside a defender, and raced into the     clear.<p>     He was chased along the sideline by Mart Lang (a prop forward no     less!) until he was eventually overhauled by Mat Sing and tackled 35     metres out from the Queensland line.  Good hands saw the ball cleared     to Brasher, then Ettinghausen and onto Menzies who scored wide on the     left.<p>     Johns again very narrowly failed to convert.<p>     But NSW led Qld 23-18 with just six minutes left.<p>     Most thought "that's it, game NSW".<p>     But not Queensland.<p>     Inside the last minute, ten metres from their own line on the second     tackle, Lockyer surprised everyone except Ben Ikin by booting the ball     50 metres down field along his right touchline.<p>     Ikin recovered the ball, was immediately trapped but somehow got a     pass away.  I lost count of the number of sets of hands the ball went     through in the next play.  Inside passes, outside passes, off loads in     tackles _ no, it couldn't possible be, could it?<p>     And then with 45 seconds left Tony Carroll crossed over, ran closer to     the posts and scored Queensland's fourth try.<p>     NSW 23 Qld 22<p>     Siren.<p>     Lockyer successfully converted.  He didn't miss one kick at goal all     night!<p>     Qld 24 NSW 23<p>     What a great game!<p>     Queensland 24 (tries to Walters, Price, Langer and Carroll, four goals     to Lockyer) defeated New South Wales 23 (tries to Wishart, Brasher,     Daley, Fittler and Menzies; one field goal to Andrew Johns)<p><center><hr noshade><A HREF="http://www.electric.on.net"        onMouseOver="waxon('home');        statuson('home'); return true;"        onMouseOut="statusoff(); waxoff('home');        return true;"><IMG name=home SRC="../buttons/butt_home_off.gif" ALT="home" WIDTH="140" HEIGHT="32" BORDER="0"></a><A HREF="../sport/index.html"        onMouseOver="waxon('sport');        statuson('sport'); return true;"        onMouseOut="statusoff(); waxoff('sport');        return true;"><IMG name=sport SRC="../buttons/butt_sport_off.gif" ALT="sport" WIDTH="140" HEIGHT="32" BORDER="0"></a><hr noshade></center><p><A HREF="http://www.electric.on.net">http://www.electric.on.net</A><p>&copy; This work is subject to copyright.
