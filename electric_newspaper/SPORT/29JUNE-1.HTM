There was a record crowd, more than140,000 at the legendary Assen circut - one of the oldest on the GPcalendar. This was particularly impressive considering The Netherlands isstill in World Cup fever. Secondly, it way Grand Prix's youngest everwinner - Marco Melandri, who at 15 years old beat championship leaderKazuto Sakata in the 125's.<p>But the heaviest action was, of course, in the 500's, where New ZealanderSimon Crafar won his his first ever podium in a Grand Prix.<p>It was without doubt one of the most exciting 500 races this season.<p>Mick Doohan (Repsol Honda) won the Dutch Grand Prix for the fifth year in a row holding off a strong challenge from Max Biaggi (Marlboro Kanemoto Honda) and Simon Crafar (Red Bull Yamaha). Alex Crivillé (Repsol Honda), who led the points table coming into Holland, faded to a distant sixth place, meaning that Biaggi, who opened the season with a win in Japan, goes back into first place in the championship, but by only three points (118-115) over Doohan. <p>Beating Doohan at Assen would have been a tall order since the Australian has won for four straight years prior to his win on Saturday, but Biaggi kept the pressure on over the final laps hoping to force Doohan into a mistake or to get an opportunity to slip past on the brakes for the final chicane.Doohan neither broke under the pressure nor did he leave an open door to theItalian.<p> Simon Crafar on his Dunlop-shod Yamaha (all the other front-runners were on Michelin), rode a brilliant race and actually led briefly when Doohan dug one of this knee sliders into the grass and was, he said, "nearly pulled off the bike." Doohan was back past before the finish line and, in fact, lead every one of the twenty laps.<p> Fourth was Brazilian Alex Barros (Gresini Honda), who always goes very well at Assen. He and Norick Abe (Yamaha Team Rainey) were in the five man battle for the early lead. Abe‚s machine stopped only four laps from the end with mechanical problems when the Japanese rider was holding fifth place. Barros was eventually fourth.<p> Carlos Checa (Movistar Honda Pons) the winner two weeks ago in Madrid, came home in a lonely fourth place, nine seconds back of Barros and eight seconds ahead of Crivillé. <p> Luca Cadalora, making his first ride on the factory Suzuki, lost the frontand went down when chasing Crivillé, but Suzuki‚s other rider, Nobustsu Aoki, in spite of feeling the effects of a big crash in Friday‚s final qualifyingsession, came home seventh in front of Repsol Honda‚s Tadayuki Okada, making his return after breaking his wrist in a practice crash for the Spanish GrandPrix.<p> Ralf Waldmann (Marlboro Team Roberts) was a non starter on his Modenas after breaking his wrist in the final qualifying session on Friday while John Kocinski (Movistar Honda Pons), already injured after crashing in the Grand Prix of the Community of Madrid, crashed again in the rain on Friday and withdrew from Assen and also from next week‚s British Grand Prix in order to give his badly cut finger (the little finger of his left hand) time toheal.<p> With only twelve points separating Biaggi in the lead from Checa, who dropped back to fourth, the points spread over the first four places is the narrowest that has been at any times after seven rounds. But, in spite of having failed to score in two rounds, Doohan has now made up 23 of the 25 points that Biaggi took from him at Suzuka.<p> The victory by Doohan allowed him to make his 88th podium appearance, equaling the FIM record of 88 for the 500 class held by Giacomo Agostini. <p><PRE>                  Pos   Rider                     Nat Total Time  Diff.                   1   1 Mick DOOHAN               AUS  41:17.788                  2   6 Max BIAGGI                ITA  41:18.348   0.560                  3   11 Simon CRAFAR             NZE  41:18.939   1.151                  4   9 Alex BARROS               BRA  41:22.939   5.151                  5   8 Carlos CHECA              SPA  41:31.615   13.827                  6   4 Alex CRIVILLE             SPA  41:39.044   21.256                  7   3 Nobuatsu AOKI             JPN  41:46.665   28.877                  8   2 Tadayuki OKADA            JPN  41:51.332   33.544                  9   55 Regis LACONI             FRA  42:02.658   44.870                  10   17 Jurgen vd GOORBERGH     NED  42:05.906   48.118                   11   18 Garry McCOY             AUS  42:29.045   1:11.257                  12   10 Kenny ROBERTS Jr.       USA  42:47.925   1:30.137                  13   23 Matt WAIT               USA  42:57.673   1:39.885                  14   88 Scott SMART             GBR  44:07.644   2:49.856                   15   26 Bernard GARCIA          FRA  44:20.475   3:02.687                  Riders Championship Standings                  1 Max BIAGGI            ITA 118                   2 Mick DOOHAN           AUS 115                   3 Alex CRIVILLE         SPA 113                   4 Carlos CHECA          SPA 106                   5 Nobuatsu AOKI         JPN 56                   6 Norick ABE            JPN 51                   7 Simon CRAFAR          NZE 50                   8 Alex BARROS           BRA 47                   9 John KOCINSKI         USA 43                   10 Tadayuki OKADA       JPN 37</PRE><p>                  250cc - 1st 250 win for Rossi<p>                  Valentino Rossi won his first 250cc Grand Prix today ashe dominated the race,                  taking the lead on lap 6 and winning by 19 seconds at theflag. However it wasn't                  a good day for his Aprilia teammates as both TesuyaHarada and Loris Capirossi                  retired on lap 9 with mechnical failure.<p>                  Olivier Jacque and Jeremy McWilliams led the pack away atthe start - though                  McWilliams was forced to pit for a stop/go penalty havingjumped into the third                  row before the green light. Within half a lap the powerof the Aprilias made itself                  felt as Capirossi and Rossi both burst to the front andproceeded to clear off. <p>                  By lap 3, Harada had also recovered from a slow start andmoved into 3rd place,                  leaving the Hondas of Perugini and Jacque to fight over4th - though this was                  settled two laps later as Perugini rammed the back of anearly-braking Jacque,                  taking them both out at turn 3.<p>                  On lap 6 Rossi went ahead of Capirossi and stepped thepace up - though by                  that time they were well ahead of the chasing pack ofUkawa, Aoki,  Tsujimura                  and D'Antin. Then came his teammates' retirement, and itwas left to Rossi to                  cruise around 22 seconds ahead of the rest of the field.<p>                  The battle for second place stepped into high gear forthe final two laps, as six                  riders - D'Antin, Ukawa, Aoki, Tsujimura, Fuchs and Portoall sensed they were                  in with a chance. With one lap to go Fuchs made thedecisive move into 2nd,                  with Aoki in 3rd. <p><PRE>                  Pos    Rider              Nat Total Time      Diff.                     1   46 Valentino ROSSI    ITA 38:31.905                             2   11 Jurgen FUCHS       GER 38:51.089     19.184                  3    6 Haruchika AOKI     JPN 38:51.421     19.516                  4    8 Luis D'ANTIN       SPA 38:53.587     21.682                  5    5 Tohru UKAWA        JPN 38:53.626     21.721                  6   27 Sebastian PORTO    ARG 38:53.832     21.927                  7   7 Takeshi TSUJIMURA   JPN 38:53.989     22.084                  8   24 Jason VINCENT      GBR 38:59.195     27.290                  9   37 Luca BOSCOSCURO    ITA 39:05.349     33.444                  10   44 Roberto ROLFO     ITA 39:09.372     37.467                  11   12 Noriyasu NUMATA   JPN 39:14.133     42.228                  12    9 Jeremy McWILLIAMS GBR 39:14.564     42.659                  13   20 William COSTES    FRA 39:22.746     50.841                  14   47 Ivan CLEMENTI     ITA 39:23.934     52.029                   15   16 Johan STIGEFELT   SWE 39:25.664     53.759                  16   25 Yasu HATAKEYAMA   JPN 39:40.408   1:08.503                  17   14 Davide BULEGA     ITA 39:40.621   1:08.716                  18   76 Jarno JANSSEN     NED 39:53.367   1:21.462                  19   75 Maurice BOLWERK   NED 39:53.451   1:21.546                  20   78 Rudie MARKINK     NED 40:16.416   1:44.511                  21   77 Andre ROMEIN      NED 40:42.946   2:11.041                  Riders Championship Standings                  1  Tetsuya HARADA                      JPN      104                  2  Loris CAPIROSSI                     ITA      90                  3  Valentino ROSSI                     ITA      85                  4  Tohru UKAWA                         JPN      73                  5  Haruchika AOKI                      JPN      64                  6  Olivier JACQUE                      FRA      56                  7  Jurgen FUCHS                        GER      45                  8  Luis D'ANTIN                        SPA      45                  9  Stefano PERUGINI                    ITA      45                  10 Takeshi TSUJIMURA                   JPN      43</PRE><p>                  125cc - Youngest ever GP winner - Marco Melandri<p>                  15-year old Italian Marco Melandri became the youngestever GP winner today                  as he beat championship leader Kazuto Sakata to the lineafter a last-lap                  overtaking move at the final chicane.<p>                  After setting fastest time by a long way in practice,Sakata looked like the                  runaway winner as he took the lead from Mirko Giansantion the first lap and                  opened up an immediate lead. However Melandri managed toget a break on the                  following pack of Tokudome, Cecchinello, Giansanti,Scalvini, Locatelli, and Petit                  and within 2 laps had caught Sakata and shadowed him forthe rest of the race. <p>                  With half a lap to go, Milandri went into the lead, butSakata fought back two                  turns later.

Jacque reinsured his already broken foot. The excitement of the final laps came from the battle for second, third and fourth between Jurgen Fuchs (Docshop Aprilia), Haruchika Aoki (F.C.C. TSS Honda), Luis D‚Antin (Antena 3 Yamaha) and Tohru Ukawa (Benetton Honda) with the four finishing in the above order. Fuchs starting from thefirst row, dropped back to last place when the engine of his Aprilia loaded up and refused to rev coming out of the first corner. The bike finally chimedback in and the German thrilled the Assen crowd with his charge through the field.  Argentina‚s Sebas Porto (PR2 Mitsubishi Elaion Aprilia had his best ever result, finishing sixth in front of Takeshi Tsujimura and Jason Vincent (Padgetts HRC Shop Honda).  Britain‚s Jeremy McWilliams jumped the start from the fourth row and was called in for a stop and go penalty, but still managed to come back up to 12th place. <p> Marco Melandri is Youngest Ever Grand Prix Winner at 15 Fifteen-year-old Italian Marco Melandri (Benetton Matteoni Honda) stalked thirty-one- year-old former World Champion Kazuto Sakata (UGT 3000 Aprilia) of Japan and made his move on the last lap to become the youngest rider ever to win a Grand Prix. (The previous youngest ever winner, Ivan Goi, who was sixteen when he won the Austrian GP of 1996, finished back in 14th place.) <p>Tomomi Manako (UGT 3000 Honda), who is now joint second in the run for the title and a distant 34 points back of Sakata, came through from a dismal start to take third place, setting a new Assen 125 race lap records in the process.     <br clear=all><p><center><hr noshade><A HREF="http://www.electric.on.net"        onMouseOver="waxon('home');        statuson('home'); return true;"        onMouseOut="statusoff(); waxoff('home');        return true;"><IMG name=home SRC="../buttons/butt_home_off.gif" ALT="home" WIDTH="140" HEIGHT="32" BORDER="0"></a><A HREF="../sport/index.html"        onMouseOver="waxon('sport');        statuson('sport'); return true;"        onMouseOut="statusoff(); waxoff('sport');        return true;"><IMG name=sport SRC="../buttons/butt_sport_off.gif" ALT="sport" WIDTH="140" HEIGHT="32" BORDER="0"></a><hr noshade></center><p><A HREF="http://www.electric.on.net">http://www.electric.on.net</A><p>&copy; This work is subject to copyright.
