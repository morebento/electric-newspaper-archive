Adelaide      reversed a lacklustre discordant performance that put them behind 18-0      after 55 minutes to come storming home and almost snatch the match.     <p>     Unfortunately for the Rams, their dominance for the last 25 minutes of      the game was punctured by a piece of individual brilliance from the      Raiders half-back, "Little Mac" Andy McFadden.     <p>     Adelaide's attack was hamstrung by what appeared to me to be refereeMoghseen      Jadwat's complete inattention to the 10 metre rule at theplay-the-ball.  This allowed      the Raiders defence to stand up offside for most of the game.     <p>     Ten minutes from full time, the diminutive McFadden recovered the ball      from a scrum that he fed in centrefield.  He immediately accelerated      between the close defence and showed pace and swerve to stand up the      Rams debutant full back, Graham Appo, race 40 metres and score under      the posts.     <p>     David Furner added the extras comfortably, to push Canberra to a 22-14      cushion.     <p>     McFadden's solo effort was the decisive play of the game.     <p>     Earlier, two tries to Raiders fullback, McFadden look-alike, Mark      McLinden, and another to big David Divoco, appeared to have the local      leaguers dead and buried at 18-0 with three-quarters of the game gone.     <p>     To their credit and to the appreciation of a crowd of around 8,000 the      Rams came back very strongly in the last quarter and almost snatched      the game from the visitors.     <p>     The Rams finished with a spirit and intensity that was absent during      the first quarter of each half.  Adelaide were unlucky not to manage a      draw.     <p>     The Adelaide team produced some scintillating play variations that had      the crowd on their feet several times in the last 20 minutes.     <p>     A few minutes from full time, the Rams produced a classic team try.       <p>     After stretching the Raiders defence out wide on the left, long      accurate passes from Walters and Golthorpe saw the ball spread wide to      the right where Graham Appo chimed in from full back.  His short pass      to Luke Williamson allowed the Adelaide centre to crash over the try      line near the right touchline.     <p>     This was the best try seen at Adelaide Oval this season.     <p>     Trailing 24-18 with three minutes to play, the Rams threatened to      score but the Raiders managed to hang on.     <p>     Mal Meninga and his injury-depleted team were fortunate to get away      with the two competition points.     <p>     Both teams scored four tries each.     <p>     Great cover defence from Adelaide winger Jensen right on the corner      post also prevented a fifth Raiders major score.     <p>     In the end, the difference on the scoreboard was the goal kicking of      David Furner for Canberra.  He was presented with four simple      conversions of Raiders tries close to the uprights.     <p>     All the Rams tries were scored out wide.  Luke Williamson narrowly      failed with two difficult kicks.  Appo was successful once from two      opportunities in similar positions.     <p>     For Canberra, Brett Hetherington was impressive hitting the ball up      from deep inside his own territory.  Several times he shredded       Adelaide's defence close to the ruck.     <p>     Furner also had a great game for the Raiders, producing two excellent      40 metre busts by bashing through the first tackle.     <p>     Aside from two moments of woeful defensive errors, the Rams tackled      well.     <p>     Both McLinden's tries came from Canberra's ability to stand up the      Rams sliding defence out wide through well timed inside passes on      simple scissor plays.     <p>     Tony Iro sparked the Rams fight back by finishing off their first try      scoring movement with a well timed run and dummy pass.     <p>     Iro was involved in almost everything in the last 20 minutes.     <p>     Bruce Mamando celebrated his return from injury almost a year ago with a      blockbusting four pointer, crunching through tackles and carrying two      Raiders defenders across their tryline.     <p>     Adelaide's fightback won them the respect of the crowd.  The defeated      Rams were given a standing ovation for their gutsy comeback.     <br clear=all><p><center><hr noshade><A HREF="http://www.electric.on.net"        onMouseOver="waxon('home');        statuson('home'); return true;"        onMouseOut="statusoff(); waxoff('home');        return true;"><IMG name=home SRC="../buttons/butt_home_off.gif" ALT="home" WIDTH="140" HEIGHT="32" BORDER="0"></a><A HREF="../sport/index.html"        onMouseOver="waxon('sport');        statuson('sport'); return true;"        onMouseOut="statusoff(); waxoff('sport');        return true;"><IMG name=sport SRC="../buttons/butt_sport_off.gif" ALT="sport" WIDTH="140" HEIGHT="32" BORDER="0"></a><hr noshade></center><p><A HREF="http://www.electric.on.net">http://www.electric.on.net</A><p>&copy; This work is subject to copyright.
