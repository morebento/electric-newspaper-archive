It was an impossible dream, of course, but Marcellino Lucchi never gave up hope. It would take some extremecircumstances for this to  happened but there was magic in the air on May17, at Mugello.<p> It fact it was a day of extremes in Mugello. The 125cc race saw theyoungest-ever rider on a GP podium when 15 year-old Marco Melandri took second. But in 250 cc race,  Aprilia factory workhorse and test rider, Marcellino Lucchifinally won his first Grand Prix in a career that began in 1982. <p> Lucchi, who really drives a garbage truck as his day gig, had orders not to overtake the regular Aprilia riders. His job in Mugello was to take points away from Honda and, he was told, he could only win if he pulled out a big lead and held it.<p> It took a very complicated scenario for all this to take place. This ishow it happened: The entire front row was filled with Aprilias. Harada was on the pole and looked capable of winning. Alongside him was Loris Capirossi, then Lucchi and on the outside of the front row the darling of the Italian fans, 19year old Valentino Rossi. <p> But at the start Harada’s had clutch problems and stalled coming off the line. Jurgen Fuchs, starting right behind Harada, swerved around the Japanese, but Roberto Rolfo and Stefano Perugini, starting from the third and fourth rows both collided with the rear of Harada’s machine. When he finally got underway he was last.<p> At the front of the field Lucchi lead, but gave way to the youngsterRossi, as he was ordered to do, and tucked in behind. Capirossi got a terrible startbut had managed to move up to third, still 9 seconds back, when suddenly a shower broke over the circuit. <p> The race was stopped and the results after six laps were taken as the basis for a new grid for the second half of the race. The rain stopped, the track dried, and the second leg of the 250 race was run with results being taken from cumulative time.<p> All Valentino Rossi had to go was get a good start. He led Lucchi by .159 of a second on corrected time. Lucchi would have accepted his role as tester and let Rossi by. But Rossi got a terrible start and Harada got a good one. Lucchi dutifully tucked in behind Harada and followed him home. Harada, running with a 9.8 second handicap on corrected time, set a quick pace that Lucchi, a master of Mugello, was easily able to match.<p> At the end of the 15 lap fans were treated to the unusual sight of Harada crossing the finish line first without even a wave of the hand while Lucchi, back in second, pumped the air with joy and his team waved their arms and embraced in pit lane. <p> The winner on corrected time was Lucchi...and he was also the fastest man on the track, putting up and looking very comfortable at all times when following Harada home. Rossi was third and Capirossi fourth. <p> And everyone lived happily ever after....except in Honda where Olivier Jacque, riding with broken bones in his foot, had to retire. <p> Hard luck man of the meeting was Jeremy McWilliams who was running in fifth in the second heat on his QUB Team Optimum race-kitted Honda when he ran out of gas.<p><center><hr noshade><A HREF="http://www.electric.on.net"        onMouseOver="waxon('home');        statuson('home'); return true;"        onMouseOut="statusoff(); waxoff('home');        return true;"><IMG name=home SRC="../buttons/butt_home_off.gif" ALT="home" WIDTH="140" HEIGHT="32" BORDER="0"></a><A HREF="../sport/index.html"        onMouseOver="waxon('sport');        statuson('sport'); return true;"        onMouseOut="statusoff(); waxoff('sport');        return true;"><IMG name=sport SRC="../buttons/butt_sport_off.gif" ALT="sport" WIDTH="140" HEIGHT="32" BORDER="0"></a><hr noshade></center><p><A HREF="http://www.electric.on.net">http://www.electric.on.net</A><p>&copy; This work is subject to copyright.
