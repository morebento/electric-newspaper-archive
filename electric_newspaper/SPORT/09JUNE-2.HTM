Thewin puts Chili into second place in the championship behind fellow Ducatirider Troy Corser, who suffered a broken gear lever in race one droppinghim to seventh, followed by a third place in race two.<p>New Zealander Aaron Slight, who was looking to dominate the meeting afterqualifying and a race one  win, crashed out in the second leg but remountedto finish a fighting fourth.<p>Second in both races was Honda's Colin Edwards.<p>Britain's Carl Fogarty had a miserable time and could only struggle aroundto two 13thplaces.<p>Race One was a fairly subdued affair. Kawasaki's Akira Yanagawa led thepack away from the line, followed by Edwards, Corser, and Haga. Edwardssoon took the lead, while fast qualifier Lavilla crashed out on the first lap.<p>As Edwards cleared off into a substantial lead, Slight was working his wayup throughthe pack, battling with Haga, Chili and Corser. By mid-race Slight hadpulled ahead ofYanagawa for second place, while Corser was dropping back with a faultygearchange - first into the clutches of Chili, and finally on the lastcorner to Suzuki's Peter Goddard who had fought his way up to the slowingfellow countryman.<p>Early championship sensation, Yamaha's Noriyuki Haga had an eventful race -initiallyfighting for third with Slight and Chili, he ran off the track on lap 9 butrejoined andmanaged to get past Corser and into 5th place by the end.<p>Up front, on a rapidly drying track, Slight set fastest lap after fastestlap and closeddown his Texan teammate. With 5 laps to go he moved into the lead and drewawayfor an easy win.<p><pre>Race One Results                  POS RIDER             BIKE      TIME            GAP                                            1.

Edwardsled into the first corner, while Suzuki's James Whitham was forced onto thegrass.Haga was briefly in second, with Slight in third. On the second lap Chiligot past Slightand up into second, and then into the lead past Edwards. <p>After that the race was largely uneventful with only brief drama as AaronSlightcrashed out whilst in second, only to remount and take fourth overall. Theatrociousweather took control and the riders splashed around in torrents and floodsof standingwater.<p>Said Chili: "It is good to come away with two podiums in such terribleconditions, butmaybe if I had the same set-up in the first race as I had in the second, itmay havebeen two firsts! In the first race I tried to push hard, but didn't getenough grip and Icouldn't control the bike. If I had pushed harder, I would've crashed forsure. In thesecond race we softened the suspension and dropped the rear a little andthat made a lot of difference. The bike wasn't perfect, but it was muchbetter and I was able toride as I wanted. I enjoyed the race and I know that, in the rain, if myDucati has agood set-up, I can win races."<p>Championship leader Corser was philosophical after the meeting. "The firstracewould've been a lot better if the gearlever hadn't broken off after aboutfive or six laps.I decided to try and keep going and I had to change gear by pushing down onandlifting up the stalk with the toe of my boot. It meant that I had to thinkabout brakinga lot before I had to brake. So, I reckon seventh was OK."<p>"In the second race, we softened up the bike and I felt that it was animprovement forsure. Not 100%, but better. Frankie got away and there was no chance ofcatchinghim, so I diced with Colin. The bike misfired a few times out of cornersand I was abit worried that I might not make the finish. It was a relief when I sawthe chequeredflag, but then the bike cut out and stopped completely before I couldcomplete thecooling down lap!"<p><pre>Race Two Results                  Pos Rider               Machine Time            Gap                  1 Pierfrancesco Chili   Ducati  40m 48.961s,                   2 Colin Edwards         Honda                   + 11.117,                   3 Troy Corser           Ducati                  + 11.925,                   4 Aaron Slight          Honda                   + 34.889,                   5 Akira Yanagawa        Kawasaki                + 37.330,                   6 Gregorio Lavilla      Ducati                  + 55.872,                   7 Noriyuki Haga         Yamaha                  + 1m04.479s,                   8 Peter Goddard         Suzuki                  + 1m14.487s,                   9 Piergiorgio Bontempi  Kawasaki                + 1m21.927s,                   10 James Whitham        Suzuki                  + 1m23.325s,                   11 Neil Hodgson         Kawasaki                + 1m23.81s,                   12 U Mark               Suzuki                  + 1m40.250s,                   13 Carl Fogarty         Ducati                  + 1m49.074s,                   14 Lucio Pedercini      Ducati                  + 1 lap,                   15 Igor Jerman          Kawasaki                + 1 lap.</pre><p>Overall Championship standings: 1 Corser 160, 2 Chilli 144, 3 Slight 144, 4Haga143, 5 Edwards 138, 6 Fogarty 134, 7 Yanagawa 79, 8 Goddard 71, 9 Whitham63.<p><center><hr noshade><A HREF="http://www.electric.on.net"        onMouseOver="waxon('home');        statuson('home'); return true;"        onMouseOut="statusoff(); waxoff('home');        return true;"><IMG name=home SRC="../buttons/butt_home_off.gif" ALT="home" WIDTH="140" HEIGHT="32" BORDER="0"></a><A HREF="../sport/index.html"        onMouseOver="waxon('sport');        statuson('sport'); return true;"        onMouseOut="statusoff(); waxoff('sport');        return true;"><IMG name=sport SRC="../buttons/butt_sport_off.gif" ALT="sport" WIDTH="140" HEIGHT="32" BORDER="0"></a><hr noshade></center><p><A HREF="http://www.electric.on.net">http://www.electric.on.net</A><p>&copy; This work is subject to copyright.
