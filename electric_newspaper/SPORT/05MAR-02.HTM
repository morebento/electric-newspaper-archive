A big rush. He's just arrived in Melbourne fromMungello  where he was testing the new Ferrari. He had to go via Dublin topay a few bills so that when he next returns to his Dalkey base theelectricity and phone won't be cut off. <p>	Hectic, manic, frantic, crazy. They're the words he uses to describe hislife at the moment. So you'd expect just about the last thing he wantsright now is an interview. "No, because I love talking about myself," hesays, grinning. "Ah, I'm just so used to it now, I don't think about it.Part of the job, y'know," he sighs.<p>	So, did you spend the winter lying on a Caribbean beach, then? "Huh!Michael (Schumacher) was in his ski lodge in Norway for two months while Iwas running around Venezuela, France, Italy, you name it - I was everywheredoing PR work for Ferrari.<p>	"It's impossible to get away from it because the situation with Michael isthat he's got a very strict contract where he only gives them so many daysfor promotional work, so I've got to fill in all those other days - so myworkload is probably a lotheavier than anyone else's in Formula One because I'm effectively doing thework of two drivers.<p>	"So the winter was hectic - I was just all over the place for Shell andMarlboro, our various sponsors, and then I was testing in January andFebruary, there was no time for anything else. I'd only nine days off inAntigua and then I went to Kitzbuhl for a few days and that was it."<p>	Venezuela, France, Italy, Antigua, Kitzbuhl? Bummer. So does all this work(and so little play) make Eddie a dull boy?<p>		"If you need a racing driver as a mate you're a sad bastard," he wasquoted as saying last year. So are they that dull?<p>	"Well, put it this way - there are a lot more interesting people in theworld than Formula One drivers, I find that any way."<p>	So they're not glamorous and exciting? "You don't know them the way I knowthem," he laughs. Are they boring? His friend Dominic, who's sitting in onthe interview, nods furiously.<p>	"We are," concedes Irvine. "I have a very wide range of friends, from veryintelligent people all the way down to Dominic, and none of them is aFormula One driver.<p>	"I just don't find them very interesting people and I like veryinteresting people. I've got a lot of friends who do very diverse thingsand it's much more interesting talking to someone who's doing somethingtotally removed from yourgame, you see a much broader spectrum of life that way . . . and I'm theboring bastard who's sitting in the middle of these intelligent people."<p>	Perhaps the fact that he doesn't find the company of his colleagues in theworld of Formula One to be all that riveting might explain why he choosesnot to live alongside so many of them in the tax haven of Monaco.<p>	"Well, if you ever go to Monaco you'd realise why I don't live there, it'sa very boring place - very boring. It tends to be full of people who valuemoney more than life, because they all go there just to save tax, but youcan't take it with you. When you're only coming this way once I think it'sbetter to pay your tax and live properly. You couldn't pay me to live there."<p>	So, instead of choosing the pleasant climate and the even more pleasanttax rates in Monaco, Irvine opts to make Dublin his home, not that he seesmuch of it. <p>	"I'm never there, I'm back about four days in the year, at the most. Ijust have a house in Dalkey and come here whenever I've nothing to do andjust sit out there and relax. Then if I want a bit of nightlife the centreof Dublin's only 15 minutes away . . . 20 minutes legally, of course.<p>	On the irritation scale only strangers who insist on talking to him aboutFormula One score higher than traffic lights. "I avoid strangers like theplague because it's amazing the number of them who don't even think that Idon't need to talk about it every hour of the week. You make it obviousthat you don't want to talk about motor racing, but they keep asking youquestions so then you just gotta walk away. Make your excuses and leave."<p>	So, eh, let's talk about Formula One. What's it like being MichaelSchumacher's understudy? "It's the worst job in the world in a way, butit's also a great job because he's the best driver. People say I playnumber two to Michael but all thedrivers play number two to him because he's better than everyone else. Atleast I'm in an environment where I can learn from him, I'm going to a verygood school.<p>	"I think I could beat anyone in F1, apart from Michael because he is a lotbetter. I've learnt a lot from him, and vice versa, but the things I'velearnt from him have made me a much better driver. Okay, there are somethings I have to do that don't help me to get a good result for myself, but, on the whole, I'vegot a very good opportunity to do well and this year, with the new car, Ithink I will have the potential to get some very good results."<p>	Irvine, once described as the man who introduced road rage to Formula One,scoffs at any suggestion that the controversies of last season were bad forthe sport, on the contrary he thought they made great press. "There are alwayscontroversies in F1, there have been since the very beginning - it's asport designed for controversies because there are so many rules. That whythe G . . . what is it . . . the GAA, there's never that much controversythere because there's no fucking rules, except that you can't shoot any ofyour opponents. F1 is designed for controversy.<p>	"The incident with Michael and Villeneuve in the final race was greatpress! What's better in a boxing match, a guy winning on a points decisionor a knock-out? Jerez (where Schumacher collided with Villeneuve) was aknock-out, I thought it was great. A great way to finish the season, andmost seasons finish in a manner like that, whenever it's been that close.Prost took Senna out in 1990, Senna took Prostout in 1991, Michael took Damon (Hill) out in 1995."<p>	So has life changed a lot since he left Jordan for Ferrari?<p>	"Well I started getting paid properly for doing a job. There's no one whomakes money out of Jordan Grand Prix other than Eddie Jordan," he laughs.<p>	Still enjoy it? "Sometimes it's wonderful, but it's like everything, if itwas wonderful all the time it'd be boring - sometimes it's hell, sometimesit's heaven. Gotta go."<p>	Right, well best of luck in the new . . . oh, he's gone. Seems they don'tcall him Fast Eddie for nothing.<p><hr noshade><p><A HREF="http://www.electric.on.net">http://www.electric.on.net</A><p>&copy; This work is subject to copyright.
