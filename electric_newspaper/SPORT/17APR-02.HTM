So we can expect some of the best individual and teamperformances of the season as players vie for spots in the side to meet thestrong Kiwi lineup on April 24.<p>There are some potentially classic confrontations that should make this themost interesting round so far.<p>FRIDAY<p>Manly v Brisbane at Brookvale Oval (Sydney)<p>The red hot Brisbane Broncos should repeat the pasting they gave the ManlySea Eagles in the opening round of the competition six weeks back.<p>However, the desperate Eagles may have more incentive.  If Manly don'tstart winning soon they might as well start planning for the playoffs in 1999.<p>A win over the undefeated Broncos would provide the turning point for theunderachieving Manly team.  A loss could see them relegated to the cellar.<p>On the other hand, the Brisbane players know that good performances infront of Bob Fulton, who coaches both Manly and Australia, will help theirchances of getting a green and gold jersey on Sunday when the Australiantest team will be announced.<p>Broncos in a canter.<p>Sydney City v Adelaide at Sydney Football Stadium (Sydney) <p>Sadly, the question here isn't who will win but rather by how much.<p>Rod Reddy has made seven changes to the Rams selection that shot themselvesin the feet against the Chargers last week.<p>Roosters easily.<p>SATURDAY<p>Canberra v Illawarra at Bruce Stadium (Canberra)<p>With their eyes on the representative opportunities the Raiders appear tobe finally running into some form.  Last outing they continued Manly'snightmare with a 26-20 win at Bruce Stadium.  Manly led 20-2 at one stage.<p>The Steeler's succumbed to St George in another close one (19-12).<p>A win for Canberra would put them into the top ten and keep Illawarra incontention for the fiercely sought 20th spot.<p>Raider's too classy at home.<p>Cronulla v Balmain at Shark Park (Sydney) <p>This promises to be the most exciting and entertaining match of the seasonso far.<p>The Sharks seem to be struggling (two wins and three losses) but so farthey have been playing the better teams in the competition, except fortheir 6-2 win over Souths in round 4.<p>The Tigers have been a breath of fresh air this year, with good oldfashioned guts and spirit and never-say-die determination on display.<p>Both teams can counter punch, and like to play fast open football.<p>The incentive for the Sharkie's will be to make ground on Balmain (4 wins,1 loss) who are ahead of them on the table.<p>Too close to call.<p>North Queensland v Newcastle at Cowboys Stadium (Townsville) <p>The Cowboys came down with an almighty crash last week when they wereabsolutely outclassed by Brisbane.  They get no respite this week when theytake on the other undefeated team, Newcastle.Out of the frying pan and into the fire!<p>This match will provide a good indicator of where North Queensland arelikely to finish at the end of the year.  They certainly have theexperience, but do they have the character?  This might turn out to be themost important game the Cowboys play in the regular season. <p>Newcastle took good care of Cronulla (24-10) last week, but the suspensionof Paul Harragon has weakened the Knights.  His absence plus the homeground advantage tip the scales the Cowboys way, but probably not by enough.<p>Knights to win a very tough encounter.<p>SUNDAY<p>North Sydney v Auckland at North Sydney Oval (Sydney) <p>This is a very interesting match.  The Auckland Warriors provide the bulkof the New Zealand test team, and this is their last hit out before theytake on Australia next week.  Their coach, Endacott, is also the Kiwi testcoach.  Both Auckland coach and team therefore have a lot at stake here.<p>The North Sydney Bears have shown consistently good form over 5 rounds ofcompetition, despite their 7th position on the premiership ladder.  Theirtwo losses were close run affairs against the undefeated Newcastle Knightsand the high flying Melbourne Storm.  They handed out a 42-8 hiding to theRabbitohs last weekend.<p>The Warriors have been patchy, but last week they ended Melbourne'sundefeated run.<p>The strong and disciplined Norths should win at home in a close one.<p>Canterbury v Gold Coast at Belmore Sports Ground (Sydney) <p>Both teams have a 1 win 4 loss record and will be fighting to get out ofthe cellar.<p>The Chargers are coming off their first win which was against wooden spoonaspirants Adelaide.  Last weekend the Bulldogs were beaten four tries totwo by Parramatta.<p>This game will be lost by one team, rather than won by their opponents.<p>Chargers to win because they will stick to their game plan and make fewermistakes, something that Canterbury can't seem to manage.<p>Penrith v St George at Penrith Football Stadium (Sydney)<p>This is a match-up between two teams in the top ten, the Panthers currentlytrailing the Dragons by one win.<p>Both teams appear to be running hot and cold.  Penrith followed up theirthrashing of the Rams with a terrible display against Balmain.  St Georgeare coming off a win against the Steelers.<p>Saints by a whisker.<p>South Sydney v Western Suburbs at Sydney Football Stadium (Sydney)<p>Another fight to the bottom, with one team guaranteed to stay there unlessthe match is drawn.<p>The Rabbitohs have shown that they can play, and reports indicate thatJulian O'Neill has put in some excellent displays at five eighth.  With TimBrasher and Chris Caruana behind and outside him, they'll cause problems ifSouths get enough ball.<p>The Magpies, however, get a great chance for their second win of theseason, and their irrepressible coach Tommy Raudonikis and inspirationalcaptain, the evergreen Paul Langmack, should be capable of lifting them.<p>Wests to win this one by sheer desperation, determination and fear of theircoach.<p>Parramatta v Melbourne at Parramatta Stadium (Sydney)<p>Plenty of incentive in this beauty between the fourth placed Eeels and thefifth placed Storm, who have both won four and lost one.<p>Both teams contain top flight backs and clever experienced forwards.<p>I'll go for Storm in this "moment-of-truth" game for the underachievingEeels, but I won't be surprised if it goes the other way.  I will besurprised if it's not a great contest.<p><center><hr noshade><A HREF="http://www.electric.on.net"        onMouseOver="waxon('home');        statuson('home'); return true;"        onMouseOut="statusoff(); waxoff('home');        return true;"><IMG name=home SRC="../buttons/butt_home_off.gif" ALT="home" WIDTH="140" HEIGHT="32" BORDER="0"></a><A HREF="../sport/index.html"        onMouseOver="waxon('sport');        statuson('sport'); return true;"        onMouseOut="statusoff(); waxoff('sport');        return true;"><IMG name=sport SRC="../buttons/butt_sport_off.gif" ALT="sport" WIDTH="140" HEIGHT="32" BORDER="0"></a><hr noshade></center><p><A HREF="http://www.electric.on.net">http://www.electric.on.net</A><p>&copy; This work is subject to copyright.
