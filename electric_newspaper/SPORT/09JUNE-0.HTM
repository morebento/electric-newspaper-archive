He was cheered by histeam mates and by the crowd on his frivolous loopy gambol and he washalf-heartedly pursued by befuddled St George defenders.  Then the clockran out on a superb, heart-stopping game of rugby league.  Needing to denySt George possession, Iro's only aim was to keep the ball to secure a welldeserved Adelaide 22-20 win.<p>Bottom-placed Adelaide's win over top-placed St George is the firstevidence that the Rams have the potential to win more frequently than theyhave so far this season. <p>The Rams showed all of the things expected of a genuine rugby league team... discipline, control, aggression, skill, speed, support for the ballcarrier, focus in defence, commitment to the tackles and good old guts anddetermination.  <p>The Rams performance was remarkable, considering the key ball playing teamspots of half-back and five-eighth were filled by “temps”, the everreliable and resilient Chris Quinn and rookie Deon Bird.<p>Newly-confirmed Rams' coach Dean Lance cleverly rotated his three-quartersroles in attack and defence.  Iro, Quinn and Bird all alternated as firstreceiver.  Appo alternated between fullback in possession and centre indefence. <p>Twenty minutes before Iro's crazy last minute antics, a humorous and happyending to the  evening for the Adelaide Rams and the 8,500 hardy fans whobraved the arctic conditions was nowhere in sight.  <p>Half-way through the second half, St George were cruising along at 20-8 andready to make it ten wins in succession.  Unfortunately for the competitionleaders, they left the cruise control on for too long.<p>Within 16 minutes, Adelaide racked up 14 unanswered points.<p>Adelaide's win over the premiership co-leaders should lift them from thebottom of the table.<p>The players, obviously very happy with their gutsy fightback, received astanding ovation from their supporters before they left the field of play.<p>The dour first half gave no warning of the excitement ahead.<p>Adelaide kicked off first and immediately showed St George they were in fora tough night at the office when their first tackle of the match rattledDragon's forward Daniel Wagon.  <p>The Ram's rushing defensive efforts in the first half gave the stars of theSt George backline, five-eighth Tony Mundine and centres Mark Coyne andJamie Ainscough, very limited opportunities in the first 30 minutes.  <p>The Rams scored first when centre Luke Williamson successfully struck apenalty goal after 7 minutes.  <p>He repeated the dose ten minutes later when St George were penalised forillegally stripping the ball from an Adelaide attacker a few metres shortof their try line.  Referee Paul Kalina found Daniel Wagon guilty of aprofessional foul and sent the offender to the “sin bin” for ten minutes.<p>The Ram's seemed very likely to score a try in the movement. Any chance waskilled off when Wagon pulled the ball from the grasp of Alan Cann while hewas being held by another St George defender.<p>David Boughton came on at around this time to give Tony Iro a breather.Iro had been much more involved in the action early in game than iscustomary for the talented New Zealand test player.<p>Boughton paid special attention to Dragon's key playmaker, Mundine.  TheAdelaide forward hit the St George five-eighth with crunching tackles ontwo notable occasions.<p>St George came very close to scoring several times in the first 25 minutes. Young Graham Appo used his speed and agility to rescue several ballskicked into the in goal area.  Rams centre David Kidwell made a try-savingtackle to end a threatening Dragon's attack in this period.<p>The high flying Dragons inevitably got onto the scoreboard with abeautifully crafted team movement that eventually provided their slipperywinger Jimmy Lenihan with a four pointer.  Dragon's fullback Lee Murphysuccessfully goaled the conversion.<p>The teams went to the ten minute break with St George leading 6-4.<p>The Rams were behind on the scoreboard at half-time but the only people atAdelaide Oval unsatisfied with the first 40 minutes were the Dragons.  Noneof the Sydney or Brisbane newspaper sports columnists predicted an Adelaidewin.  Footytab gave the Rams 14 and a half points start.<p>Adelaide offered fewer fumbles (4) than St George (6) in the first half.The Rams did concede more penalties (7 to 5), so opportunities inpossession were about even.  Most of the penalties conceded by Adelaidewere for tackles above the shoulder.<p>Rams coach Dean Lance might have worked some sort of magic during thebreak.  Within 3 minutes of the resumption, Tony Iro drew the St Georgeblind side defenders into a slide near half way and neatly timed a pass toa motoring Mark Corvo.  <p>The strong Adelaide front row forward burst through the Dragons defence,raced thirty five metres downfield and found his ever alert winger MatDaylight charging down the right touchline in support.  Corvo drew the lastdefender, fullback Murphy, and threw a lovely pass to provide Daylight aclear passage to the corner.<p>The difficult conversion attempt at goal by Luke Williamson was unsuccessful.<p>Behind 8-4, the Dragons lifted their intensity.  Jeff Hardy cleverlyexploited the soft footing to repeatedly sprint out of dummy half, eludingthe markers who were glued to the mire and picking up 7 to 8 metres at will.<p>The Rams defence was quickly scrambled allowing Dragons fullback Murphyenough opportunity to elude three despairing attempted tackles and touchdown under the posts in the 47th minute.  He goaled to convert and StGeorge were back in front 12-8.  <p>It was all Saints for the next ten minutes.  Murphy slotted over a penaltyin the 55th minute to the derision of the crowd who believed the refereemade a fundamental error.  This took Saints out to 14-8.<p>A minute later the Dragons produced a classy team movement that saw BenKusto score a try in a very handy position for the conversion.  Murphy hadno problem with the goal conversion and Saints were now out to 20-8.<p>With 20 minutes to go and Adelaide needing two converted tries to tie, StGeorge started to toy with the opposition when they had the ball.  Afterall, they hadn't lost a game for almost three months and they were playingone of the bottom teams.<p>Their overconfidence was unfounded.<p>Adelaide were to stun the premiership pretenders with three unanswered tries!<p>Inspirational performances by several of the more experienced Rams,especially Iro, Walters and Quinn, lifted the Rams to a great team effortin the last 25 minutes.<p>Adelaide's ball control in this crucial period of the game was faultless.At the same time, St George repeatedly coughed up the ball in powerful Ramstackles or simply fumbled the ball.  Adelaide's defence during this periodsurprised St George.<p>Kerrod Walters' passing from dummy half was particularly good in thisperiod of sustained Rams possession.  He delivered the ball beautifully toIro on several occasions and the tall second rower created opportunitiesfor Adelaide's fast outside backs.<p>This pair of internationals combined in the 60th minute to give Appo asniff of chance out wide on the left and the video referee confirmed thatthe diminutive fullback had somehow snuck in for a four pointer.  Dragons20 Rams 12<p>Adelaide's defence lifted and St George struggled to get out of their ownterritory.  Chris Quinn really got the pulse rates at Adelaide Oval racingwhen his persistent attempts to pressure Mundine's kicking game wererewarded with a great kick charge down that Quinn regathered to put theRams into a great attacking position.<p>A couple of plays later Walters pass found Iro whose short grubber kickinto the Dragons' in goal area in the 67th minute was pounced on by theirrepressible Appo.  Dragons 20 Rams 16.<p>With 12 minutes to play, St George should have taken control of their gameto put the Adelaide minnows away.  But they failed to take the opportunity. A Dragons' knock-on and then a  penalty gave the Rams their chance.<p>And they carefully constructed play to take advantage.<p>In the 77th minute, a pass from Walters at dummy half found substitute SamFalaafi who threw a long high ball to Kidwell.  His pass found the flyingDaylight who touched down near the right hand corner.<p>Scores were then level.<p>Graham Appo then kicked his only goal of the evening to put the home teamin front 22-20 with three minutes to play.<p>Adelaide executed a sensible “no passing” set of allowed six plays and StGeorge turned the ball back to their opposition in their first tackle play.<p>Game over (almost)!<p>Tony Iro's impetuosity confirmed the result.<p>Can the Rams win their first away game of the season when they travel toOlympic Park next weekend to meet rugby league debutantes Melbourne Storm,who are currently THIRD in the NRL rankings?<p><center><hr noshade><A HREF="http://www.electric.on.net"        onMouseOver="waxon('home');        statuson('home'); return true;"        onMouseOut="statusoff(); waxoff('home');        return true;"><IMG name=home SRC="../buttons/butt_home_off.gif" ALT="home" WIDTH="140" HEIGHT="32" BORDER="0"></a><A HREF="../sport/index.html"        onMouseOver="waxon('sport');        statuson('sport'); return true;"        onMouseOut="statusoff(); waxoff('sport');        return true;"><IMG name=sport SRC="../buttons/butt_sport_off.gif" ALT="sport" WIDTH="140" HEIGHT="32" BORDER="0"></a><hr noshade></center><p><A HREF="http://www.electric.on.net">http://www.electric.on.net</A><p>&copy; This work is subject to copyright.
