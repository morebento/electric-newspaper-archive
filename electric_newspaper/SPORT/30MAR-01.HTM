The Rams trailed the Canterbury Bulldogs (Sydney) all      night, and were 20-10 down midway through the second half.  Tries      scored by centre Peter Clarke (64th minute) and back row forward Marty      McKenzie (75th minute), both converted by half back Craig Kimmorley,      put the Rams in front on the scoreboard when it counted, and got them      their first win of 1998, defeating the Bulldogs 22-20 in a tense, high      quality and very entertaining match.<p>          This was the best game of rugby league played at Adelaide Oval so far.       Both teams were tigerish in defence, and it was this aspect of      Adelaide's game late in the first half when Canterbury enjoyed a glut      of possession that ultimately saved them.  The Rams were also able to      obtain good field position and capitalise.  Early on they conceded      relatively soft tries to Greg Fleming (fullback) and Mat Ryan (centre)      but were able to respond with tries of their own to stay in touch with      the Dogs and trail 14-10 at half time.  At that stage the difference      between the teams on the scoreboard was the goal kicking of Daryl      Halligan.<p>          Kimmorley, standing in at half back for suspended Noel Goldthorpe, had      an excellent game for Adelaide.  His quick reading of the defence, and      well timed pass put big Rams winger Joe Tamani over for their first      try.  Tony Iro started on the Adelaide bench as usual, and played in      the second row in defence and in the centres in attack.  His timing,      running and ball handling skills caused panic in the Canterbury      defence. He threw the final pass to Wayne Simonds who scored      Adelaide's second try late in the first half.  Simonds' try was a      classic piece of football and came after two inspiring bursts down the      centre of the ruck by hooker/dummy-half, Kerrod Walters.  After the      second of these incisive runs, the Rams moved the Bulldogs defence to      their right by attacking the northeast corner.  The tiring berries      defence could not cope with the well executed backline movement that      put Simonds over in the north western corner on the next play. <p>         As usual, the Rams forwards were able to dominate their opponents in      the latter periods of both halves.  Their fitness, speed and      enthusiasm, plus coach Rod Reddy's judgement on the interchange, are      their strengths.  Unlike previous home matches however, the Rams were      able to switch the point of attack once the opposition defence was      rolling back.  In the final analysis, the Rams attacking ability and      ball control won them the game.  Their kicking and kick chase in the      second half put the Bulldogs under enormous pressure.  Despite      trailing by ten points midway through the second half, Adelaide      methodically strangled the life out of Canterbury.  The Dogs kicking      game fell apart, and this allowed the Rams to put Canterbury's defence      under sustained pressure.  The Bulldog's did not deserve to lose after      such determined tackling, but Adelaide did not allow them to escape      from their own quarter for almost the last 15 minutes of the game.  <p>          Canterbury coach Steve Folkes might consider the result unfortunate      since ace goal kicker Daryl Halligan hit the uprights twice.<p>          It would be unfair to single out any individual in the winning side      because there were so many excellent contributions to a great team      effort.  Adelaide's luck was bound to improve sooner or later, after      gallant losses in the first two rounds of the season.  This win, over      much more fancied opponents (Adelaide had ten-and-a-half points start      on footytab), will lift the Rams confidence for their next clash      against the Penrith Panthers in Sydney, who are coming off a loss      against the Brisbane Broncos.  <p><center><hr noshade><A HREF="http://www.electric.on.net"        onMouseOver="waxon('home');        statuson('home'); return true;"        onMouseOut="statusoff(); waxoff('home');        return true;"><IMG name=home SRC="../buttons/butt_home_off.gif" ALT="home" WIDTH="140" HEIGHT="32" BORDER="0"></a><A HREF="../sport/index.html"        onMouseOver="waxon('sport');        statuson('sport'); return true;"        onMouseOut="statusoff(); waxoff('sport');        return true;"><IMG name=sport SRC="../buttons/butt_sport_off.gif" ALT="sport" WIDTH="140" HEIGHT="32" BORDER="0"></a><hr noshade></center><p><A HREF="http://www.electric.on.net">http://www.electric.on.net</A><p>&copy; This work is subject to copyright.
