The North Queensland COWBOYS defeated the Adelaide RAMS 18-8      under lights at Adelaide Oval.  <p>The intermittent rain in Adelaide on      Friday afternoon increased in intensity from about 15 minutes before      the start of the first grade fixture and continued throughout the      night.  The rain, the lights, the slippery surface and greasy ball,      combined with a chilly, occasionally gusting cross wind from the      sou'west, provided less than ideal conditions for players, officials      and fans.     <p>     This was an eagerly anticipated match for a number of reasons.  Most      rugby league supporters are pleased that the war between Super League      and the Australian Rugby League ended in a "unified" competition, and      are hopeful that 1998 will be a better year than 1997.  <p>Also, the      opening clash for the Adelaide RAMS at home to the COWBOYS had some      obvious interest.  The Townsville-based North Queensland Cowboys      collected the Super League "wooden spoon" last year but they had the      "wood" on the Rams in 1997.  Their coach, Tim Sheens, is highly      respected as a result of the outstanding performances of the Canberra      Raiders under his direction in the past.  <p>The Cowboys' starting lineup      includes a front row of Lomax, Steve Walters and Roberts, backed up by      Dale Shearer at fullback.  It is an extremely talented and experienced      outfit.  On paper at least, the Cowboys appear capable of beating most      opposition.  <p>Most Adelaide fans would have found the Rams rookie      performance last year reasonable.  Their poor "home" record was one of      their biggest handicaps.  It was always going to take more than a few      months for these displaced easterners to settle in to South Australia      and regard Adelaide Oval as home.  A better home record is likely this      season.  <p>There was also considerable interest in the debut      performances of the Rams' new signings, especially half back Noel      Goldthorpe.  Some observers predicted Goldthorpe's presence as first      or second receiver behind the ruck would provide the Rams with more      options when in possession, and take pressure off Kerrod Walters,      Maybon and Quinn, all of whom produced outstanding attacking displays      last season.     <p>     Unfortunately the 11,000 plus crowd had their committment rewarded in      the worst possible way when the Rams failed to gather a well judged      kick off from the opening whistle and handed the opposition the ball      to feed a scrum packed about 25 metres from goal.  The Cowboys were      thus on the attack from the start of the match, and did      extraordinarily well to control the ball for the next 25 minutes      considering the appalling conditions.  <p>During this period, the Rams      conceded penalties for ruck infringements, one of which let Ferris      open the Cowboys account.  The Rams defence uncharacteristically      hesitated and missed tackles, presenting Steve Walters with what      looked like a soft try but was the result of sustained pressure from      the Cowboys and good anticipation, stepping and a dummy pass from      Walters.  <p>The Rams also completed the categories on the error sheet by      committing the other major mistake, failure to control the ball when      in possession.  One dropped the ball was scooped by Shearer who      immediately sprinted 40 metres to score near the posts, despite the      desperate attempted cover attention of Goldthorpe.  <p>It would not be      fair to blame the Rams completely for the 14-0 scoreline after 25      minutes, without praising the Cowboys defence, which was exemplary      during this period.  The North Queenslanders were mobile, disciplined      and enthusiastic in defence during this period and this contributed      significantly to the early spate of Adelaide errors.  <p>After this the      bad news for Adelaide ended, and they proceeded to dominate the latter      period of the first half.  Unfortunately, the game was lost by then.     <p>     The introduction of Kerrod Walters, who was team captain last year      but started this game from the bench, immediately transformed the      Rams in attack and defence.  Goldthorpe, who had already made his      presence felt in defence, now started to find some space and some      time with the ball in his hands.  This was to become a feature of      much of the play in the second half.     <p>     The Adelaide forwards more than matched their better credentialled      opposition, and Cann proved very difficult for the Cowboys defence to      contain on several occasions.  <p>The Rams recovery came from one of his      bursts down the blind side in the first half.  Cann broke a couple of      tackles at the advantage line and, showing an unexpected degree of      speed, drew the cover defence well to set up his supports.  His inside      pass was deflected by a defender into the path of the Rams right      winger, Timani, who toed the ball ahead, outpaced Cowboys back rower      Cunningham, regathered on the line and scored the Rams first try for      the season in the right northern corner late in the first half.  The      third referee delayed play for quite some time before the score was      awarded.  Goldthorpe was unsuccessful with the attempted conversion,      and the players went to the break with the Rams trailing by 14-4.     <p>     The second half continued in a similar pattern to the last period of      the first half.  Ball control was poor on both sides but this was not      surprising considering the conditions, with rain persisting throughout      the second stanza.  Each team scored an unconverted try during the      second half, Nandruka for Townsville and Maybon for Adelaide.  The Rams      also planted the ball behind the Cowboys line on two other occasions      but each time a try was disallowed for an infringement in the lead up      play.  Both teams varied their play intelligently in the second half,      which produced patches of exciting attack and assertive defence.  The      Cowboys defence appeared fragile down the centre on a few occasions but      they were very solid in this aspect out wide.     <p>     So it was a dreadful result for Adelaide.  Hopefully, the next time      they turn in 20 minutes of mistakes it will be at the end, rather than      the start, of a match.  Speaking of starts, Rams coach Reddy puzzled      most fans by excluding Kerrod Walters from the starting lineup.       Considering how important the first 10-15 minutes of a game can be in      determining the result, it will be interesting to see whether he      persists in this strategy.     <p>     Adelaide's next opponents, the Manly-Warringah SEA EAGLES, have played      in the last three (ARL) grand finals, and are favoured to do so again      this season.  The Sea Eagles are smarting from the spanking they      received from the BRONCOS in Brisbane, and provide quite a challenge      for the Rams.  The clash between Toovey, the energetic and vociferous      Manly half back, and Goldthorpe, should be a feature of the game.  The      Rams showed in the second half against the Cowboys they have the      capacity to produce exciting attack, and Manly have shown many times      that they are susceptible to sustained pressure.  However, if the Rams      reproduce their error count from last Friday against Manly they will be      buried.       <p><hr noshade><p><A HREF="http://www.electric.on.net">http://www.electric.on.net</A><p>&copy; This work is subject to copyright.
