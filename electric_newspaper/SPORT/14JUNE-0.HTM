Doohan went down and when he tried to pick up his works Honda he saw the handlebar had been ripped off by the impact. <p> With Doohan out of action only a few seconds after the start, Spain's Carlos Checa (Movistar Honda Pons) and Alex Crivill&#233; (Repsol Honda) led the pack past the huge grandstands at the Le Mans esses. As Spanish and Catalan flags waved and air horns sounded, they were followed by the two Yamaha Team Rainey riders, Norick Abe and Luca Cadalora and by another Spaniard, Sete Gibernau, on the Repsol Honda V-twin.<p> For Carlos Checa it was the opportunity he had been waiting two weeks for. "After leading the French GP for so many laps only to lose both the lead and second place at the end," he said the day before the race, "I just want a chance to get back into the same situation. I won't make the same mistake again."<p> Championship leader Alex Crivill&#233; tucked in behind his fellow countryman but Checa set a searing opening pace, lapping in 1'33.6 on lap two. Checa had fitted a softer rear tire than any of the other Honda V-4 riders and this may have helped him set what would be the new lap record on only the second lap. Crivill&#233; tucked in behind and gradually began closing the gap. He might have been content to sit behind Checa for most of the race were it not for pressure applied by Luca Cadalora. Cadalora, in turn, was feeling the close attentions of Nobuatsu Aoki (Suzuki), and Aoki was very aware that he had Sete Gibernau sitting on his rear wheel and waiting to pounce.<p> Cadalora made an attempt to pass Crivill&#233;, but ran wide at turn one and was briefly passed by Aoki, but shot back past the Japanese at the Le Mans esses. Crivill&#233;, feeling Cadalora's breath on his neck, began to look for a way past Checa, but Checa was a wall.<p> Crivill&#233; kept beating on the wall and finally made a bid to take Checa on the brakes at end of the home straight at the start of lap 14, but, likeCadalora, he got in too deep. Unlike Cadalora he was unable to save it and ran off into the sandtrap at the end. He managed to keep the rear wheel spinning and got turned and back into the race back in tenth place.<p> That gave Cadalora the opportunity to go after Checa. For the next twelve laps Cadalora hounded the Spaniard and we will never know if he would have been able to get by because on lap 26, just four from the end, the Yamaha broke a connecting rod and rattled to a stop, ending a great ride by the 35 year old Italian veteran who was called back into action to replace the injured Jean-Michel Bayle in Yamaha Team Rainey.<p> Abe had been matching the pace of the leaders and, when Cadalora's engine broke, he suddenly stepped up the pace and closed on Checa. Just back of Abe was Sete Gibernau who had gotten the better of Nobuatsu Aoki.. <p> This time Checa made no mistakes and got better drive out of the Bugatti hairpin, Abe's last opportunity to pass. The win was only the second for Checa in his brief (40 starts) 500 career. Abe was a strong second and Gibernau a brilliant third.<p> Crivill&#233;, in spite of his excursion onto the gravel, came back to finishfifth not only preserved but increase his points lead. He came back from eighth at the end of lap 14 to take fifth and passed Biaggi three laps from the end. Biaggi was sixth. Crivill&#233; was unaware that Doohan had crashed and the first question he asked when he got off the bike was, "Did Mick win?"<p> Crafar, after being taken off the track in the Doohan-Biaggi incident,battled back to finish eighth, just back of team mate Regis Laconi. Alex Baros (Gresini Honda) came home ninth, followed by Ralf Waldmann (Marlboro Team Roberts) on the Modenas KR3.<p> John Kocinski (Movistar Honda Pons) crashed on lap one when he was bumped off by Alex Barros. The American suffered a cut to the littlefinger of his left hand but should be fit for Assen in two weeks.<p> For Honda it was the 21st consecutive victory, setting a new FIM 500 record, but with both Cadalora and Abe beginning to show the true potential of the 1998 Yamaha V-4 and Nobuatsu Aoki getting more comfortable and aggressive with the works Suzuki, it is unlikely that this streak willcontinue for the rest of the season<p> Harada Wins Incident-Packed 250 Grand Prix Tetsuya Harada (Aprilia) took the lead on lap one and then diced briefly with team mate Valentino Rossi (Nastro Azzuro Aprilia), but the Italian teenager, who led the second lap, crashed (a high-sider) on lap three leaving Harada to pull slowly away from Tohru Ukawa (Benetton Honda) and go on to his 12th career victory, his third of the present season and his second in a row.<p> The former (1993) 250 World Champion now leads by 14 points from team mate Loris Capirossi.<p> Capirossi overshot his braking at the end of the straight at the start of lap three. He had overtaken Britains Jeremy McWilliams (QUB Team Optimum TSR Honda) but slammed into the back of Olivier Jacque's Chesterfield Tech 3 Honda. The Frenchman, who was already riding with two broken bones in his left foot, was carried off the track on a stretcher, but he suffered no serious injuries and will be back for Assen where he and other NSR Honda riders hope for more new parts and more improvement.<p> The excitement of the race was centered on the battle between McWilliams, Jurgen Fuchs (Docshop Aprilia), Huruchika Aoki (F.C.C. TSR Honda) and Jose Luis Cardoso (Antena 3 Yamaha). This scrap was originally for third place until Capirossi, back on the track after his run across the gravel, blasted past to take third. <p> Fuchs eventually took over fourth with Cardoso finishing fifth. Ulsterman McWillaims strong race ended when he was taken out by Aoki. With so many top riders out, privateers like Cardoso, D'Antin (Antena 3 Yamaha)Japan's Takeshi Tsujimura seventh on his TCC Semprucci Yamaha) and Britain's Jason Vincent, who was eight , an opportunity to shine.<p> First Win for Lucio Cecchinello The 125 race was won by 28 year old Italian Lucio Cecchinello (Givi Honda LCR) who took the lead from Mirko Giansanti (UGT 3000 Honda) and Tomomi Manako (OXS Matteoni Honda). It was fortunate that Cecchinello, who hard been following Giansanti and Manako the entire race, made his move when he did. Otherwise he would probably have been taken down when Manako crashed in front of Giansanti, taking him out.<p> Cecchinello won from 15 year old Marco Melandri (Benetton Matteoni Honda), second for the third consecutive Grand Prix. Sakata, who was ill from the flu, came home fourth with his UGT 3000 Aprilia and extended his lead in the points table to thirty points.<p> Spain's Emilio Alzamora (Via Digital Aprilia), showing much improved form at Jarama, retired with mechanical problems when running in the leading group.<p> Cecchinello dedicated his victory to his injured team mate Noboru Ueda who is recovering from a broken arm and a radial nerve injury and is not expected to return until the very end of the season. <p><center><hr noshade><A HREF="http://www.electric.on.net"        onMouseOver="waxon('home');        statuson('home'); return true;"        onMouseOut="statusoff(); waxoff('home');        return true;"><IMG name=home SRC="../buttons/butt_home_off.gif" ALT="home" WIDTH="140" HEIGHT="32" BORDER="0"></a><A HREF="../sport/index.html"        onMouseOver="waxon('sport');        statuson('sport'); return true;"        onMouseOut="statusoff(); waxoff('sport');        return true;"><IMG name=sport SRC="../buttons/butt_sport_off.gif" ALT="sport" WIDTH="140" HEIGHT="32" BORDER="0"></a><hr noshade></center><p><A HREF="http://www.electric.on.net">http://www.electric.on.net</A><p>&copy; This work is subject to copyright.
