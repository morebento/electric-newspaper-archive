In some ways there was a kind of poetic justice in Alex‚s win over four times 500 World Champion, Australian Mick Doohan.<p> It was here in 1996 that Crivillé on his Repsol Honda was leading his team- mate Doohan by a narrow margin on the final lap when a crowd invasion of fans, all cheering for Alex, caused, he said, a loss of concentration that allowed Doohan to close the gap and then pounce on the last corner. <p>Two years ago Crivillé crashed within sight of the finish and Doohan won.<p>Ironically Crivillé‚s raceday began when he crashed in the final minutes of the warm-up on the same corner where he had crashed two years earlier in that battle with Doohan. <p>Today the crowd cheered but stayed behind the barriers and Crivillé, who was being caught late in the race by both Doohan and Biaggi, reached back and came up with that little extra that he needed to keep just out of reach. <p> "On the final laps Mick was catching me. I kept seeing my margin getting smaller on my pit board, but I knew where Mick would attack... on the final corner, just like he did in 1996. On the last lap I knew I had to get my head down and take a few meters back and then I had to ride a defensive line through the last corner. When I could see the exit of the corner I knew I had won," he said.<p> Actually he was quicker than Doohan on the last two laps and the Australian was not close enough to make a move at the Ducados hairpin. <p> At the start the leader was Alex Barros (Gresini Honda) from Doohan, Crivillé, Biaggi (Marlboro Kanemoto Honda), Checa (Movistar Honda Pons), Okada (Repsol Honda) and Abe (Yamaha Team Rainey).<p> Carlos Checa on pole got a terrible start but Mick Doohan, starting just behind him on the second row, got a flier and beat everyone out of the first corner except Brazilian Alex Barros.<p>The bad start by Checa was  compounded when he made a mistake trying toovertake Barros and lost a  place and valuable time. <p> Doohan barged past Barros on the brakes to take the lead at the start of lap two and Biaggi also narrowly squeezed past the late-braking Brazilian to go into third. Crivillé, back in fourth needed two more laps to move into third.<p> "When I was behind Biaggi and Doohan I saw that I could run with them and a waited until it looked like Max might be starting to drop back just abit. I got past and started to close on Mick. We fought hard on the brakes. I got past once, but he came right back on the next corner. It is very hard to pass here so I didn‚t want to be in the position of having to pass Mick on thelast lap. I wanted that to be his problem," said Crivillé after his second win in Jerez in the last three years.<p> The race pace at mid distance was in the low 1'45's but when Crivillé made his move he briefly dipped into the 44's and managed to pull out a lead of .8 of a second by lap 19. But with seven laps to go Doohan, with Biaggi on his rear wheel, started to pull back on the Spaniard.<p> "When I saw the margin getting smaller I was worried. When the lead got down to 2 tenths of a second I knew Mick was almost close enough to set up his move on the brakes either at the end of the home straight or on the final hairpin, so it was time to go," the winner explained after the race.<p> And go he did. He put up a lap of 1'44.7 and pulled back a valuable tenth of a second over Doohan on the penultimate lap. With fireworks going off and the fans screaming Crivillé held off Doohan for the final time around the 4.4 kilometer circuit and wheelied over the line to win the Spanish GP for the second year in a row.<p> Biaggi actually was the quickest man on the track on the penultimate lap, closing hard on Doohan, but at the flag he was third and a second back of the winner. <p> "I really enjoyed that race," said Doohan. "I always knew it was going to be tough to get past Alex. My front tire wasn't working well enough to make me want to try one of our famous last lap incidents! When I was leading from Biaggi I briefly saw his front wheel at Pons Corner, but I never actually saw him. At that point I got a glance at his board and saw it had "somebody +0" on it but I didn't actually know that it was Alex who was coming. When Alex came by I knew he would really want to win here and it would be hard to beat him."<p> Biaggi said, "I saw several chances to go ahead, but I didn‚t because I wasn‚t sure I could hold onto the lead. At the end of the race I thought I might have a go at Mick on the last lap, but I had a big slide exiting the hairpin and the end of the back straight and that lost me a lot of time. But this is my learning year--third is okay!"<p> Crivillé was close to tears shortly after the race when he gave his victory a special meaning. "I want to dedicate this win to my father."<p> Alex's father died in February just as Alex was beginning to prepare for the season. His friends say that Alex, who was very close to his father, has not been himself on the bike in pre-season testing or at the first two racesof the season.  Carlos Checa was close but never close enough to get into the scrap for the lead. "I made a bad start and the first five laps went badly. It wasdifficult to overtake Barros and then I made a mistake and lost to much ground."<p> Alex Barros was pleased to be able to hold off Abe to take third. Biaggi still leads the championship after three rounds with Crivillé second just 6 points back and Doohan trailing the Italian by 12 points. <p> The next race will be the Italian Grand Prix at Mugello where Biaggi will be the focus of adoring fans. Doohan, however, has won at Mugello for the last five years in a row. <p><center><hr noshade><A HREF="http://www.electric.on.net"        onMouseOver="waxon('home');        statuson('home'); return true;"        onMouseOut="statusoff(); waxoff('home');        return true;"><IMG name=home SRC="../buttons/butt_home_off.gif" ALT="home" WIDTH="140" HEIGHT="32" BORDER="0"></a><A HREF="../sport/index.html"        onMouseOver="waxon('sport');        statuson('sport'); return true;"        onMouseOut="statusoff(); waxoff('sport');        return true;"><IMG name=sport SRC="../buttons/butt_sport_off.gif" ALT="sport" WIDTH="140" HEIGHT="32" BORDER="0"></a><hr noshade></center><p><A HREF="http://www.electric.on.net">http://www.electric.on.net</A><p>&copy; This work is subject to copyright.
