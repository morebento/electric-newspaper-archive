"I looked in my mirrors andsaw nothing, so when I was called in for the penalty, I did not understand asI knew I had not speeded in the pit-lane."<p>Schumacher saw the pacesetting McLarens of Mika Hakkinen and DavidCoulthard both retire with mechanical problems early on and then overcamea strong challenge from Italian Giancarlo Fisichella in a Benetton to record avictory that would be the 29th of his career and second of the season.<p>But the German did not have an easy afternoon. He moved to the front whenleader Coulthard retired on lap 18 with a throttle problem, but then lost thelead a lap later when he entered the pits to refuel.<p>That left Fisichella at the front in his Benetton and when Schumacher washanded the penalty for pushing Frentzen off the track as he emerged from thepits -- adding to his lengthy list of driving controversies -- it seemed tobe theItalian's day.<p>But Schumacher recovered, taking the lead on lap 42 when Fisichellastopped for fuel, and he built up enough of an advantage to stay in frontafterhis second stop on lap 50. He finished 16.662 seconds ahead of Fisichella.<p>Briton Eddie Irvine was third for Ferrari with Austrian Alexander Wurzfourth in a Benetton despite causing a first corner race stoppage when hebarrel-rolled his car. Three other cars were involved but all the drivers madethe restart. The safety car came out to slow the field moments after a secondmultiple accident on the re-start and was used again later because of furtheraccidents and debris on the track.<p>Schumacher has a long history of being involved in controversial collisionswith rivals. In 1994 he won the world championship after colliding with rivalHill, while last year he was stripped of the runner-up spot in the worldchampionship following a collision with Jacques Villeneuve in the final race.<p>And the German was left fuming himself with former world champion Hillafter accusing him of dangerous driving.<p>The incident occurred on lap 38 when the pair were battling for secondplace. Hill weaved across the track a number of times to defend his positionand, as they headed toward the final chicane, the pair nearly banged wheels.<p>"That was purely dangerous," Schumacher said. "If you kill somebody, youhave to do it in a different way -- not at 320 kph.<p>"It is all right to defend your position once, but to move across the trackthree times is unacceptable. There is no excuse for nearly banging wheels.<p>"I wonder why he doesn't get punished and I find it impossible that such anexperienced man does that. I will be having words."<p>Damon Hill later accused Formula One track judges of giving MichaelSchumacher preferential treatment as he launched into a verbal assault onhis old rival on Monday.<p>Hill called the German a "bully" as their war of words which erupted aftertheir clash in Sunday's Canadian Grand Prix in Montreal rumbled on.<p>"Michael just came straight out of the pits, swooped across the track andFrentzen had nowhere to go," said Hill. "He pushed him off the track.<p>"It's not the sort of thing that a professional driver really should be doing.There is a way of racing without being a bully about the whole thing.<p>"Michael is an extremely talented driver, but he is occasionally given thebenefit of the doubt. The guy is treated leniently for whatever reason, and Ithink that gives him the feeling he can do pretty well what he likes in theracing car.<p>"He has got a set of rules all for himself. We all have to stick to therules andrespect them. If he does not like that he should keep his mouth shut."<p>Schumacher famously escaped punishment when he collided with Hill in thecontroversial climax to the 1994 season in Adelaide to pip his Britishrival byjust one point and clinch his first drivers' crown.<p>The 29-year-old also upset McLaren's David Coulthard in Argentina earlierthis year when an overtaking manoeuvre went without censure despite theScottish driver's claims he was too aggressive.<p>Schumacher, who claimed he simply did not see Frentzen as he emergedfrom a pit-stop, had launched into an attack on Hill. He said Hill, driving aJordan, could have got one of them killed in a battle for second place.<p>Hill answered Schumacher's claims after the race and returned to the attackon Monday, saying: "Michael was not very happy with my approach, but Iam sure he will live. We had some fun - I just wish he had a little bit morehumour about him sometimes. We were racing for second position. <p>"He cannot complain about someone else doing something dangerous whenhe is doing the same thing."<p>Schumacher did apologise to Frentzen after the race but did not go and seeHill, despite saying he would have a 'big word' with him.<p>"He is always threatening to do something, but he is never brave enough,"blasted Hill, who eventually retired with an electrical problem.<p>"If he had come to see me I would not have been sympathetic."<p><pre>Pos  Driver                   Nat  Constructor                Time------------------------------------------------------------------ 1.
