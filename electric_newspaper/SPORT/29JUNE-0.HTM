The post race media conference: Doohan, Biaggi, and Crafar</font></B>     <br>     <FONT SIZE="-1">Mick Doohan speaks unexclusively to The Electric Newspaper:</FONT>     <p>"It's good fun to have a close race, and it's always close at Assen - firstwith Schwantz, then Barros, Puig,  Criville and now these guys," Doohansaid after the race.<p>"Crafar came past a couple of corners after I caught my knee slider in thegrass - that nearly tore me off the bike."<p>Max Biaggi was happy to lead the championship again. "It wasn't an easyrace," grinned Biaggi. "I got a great start but Abe got in my way and thenI had to catch Mick. From then on we were so close every lap, and sometimesCrafar came past at the chicane. But I was faster through other sections ofthe track. The last few laps were a lot of fun - they were the key to therace and I had some really long and controlled rear-wheel slides. On thefinal lap I tried to go inside Doohan a few times, but he closed the dooron me.<p>"I'm happy because I'm back on the podium and - thanks to our tests atBarcelona last week we are back on track with the bike, so I'm lookingforward to Donington. The points lead means nothing though, not at thisstage of the season."<p>Simon Crafar showed he's another new force to be reckoned with in the 500class,taking the lead in the late stages, finally finishing third for his first500 podium. "I was quite happy at that pace," said the Red Bull  Yamahaman. "I was having to use more corner speed to make up what I was losing inother places, but I had a great time out there!<p>"I feel really good. Everything just worked really well. I really enjoyedthe race. In the beginning I didn't get as good a start as I would havewanted and I was worried that Mick might get away. When I got up there Iwas happy to just sit behind him. I had really good  corner speed but Ijust didn't have such good drive out of the slow turns. Mick seemed to bedropping the pace at one stage and I saw Barros catching us abit so I went past him to try and pick up the pace again. I knew that Mickcould get past with the tow so I didn't really think I was going to win. <p>"It was a little scary at times because I was having to ride so hard. Thisbike has always been good enough to be right up there and the real changehas come from Dunlop. I think the front tyre was probably the best outthere. I really hope we can carry on now. I like Donington and my resultshave always been good there and Dunlops work pretty well there so I'll begoing for it again."<p>Alex Criville could only manage sixth at Assen, losing the WorldChampionship in the process. "I've never had such a bad race at Assen,"said the Repsol Honda rider. "I had some bad chatter problems which werecosting  me more than a second a lap. But the battle for the title is stillwide open."<p>Nobuatsu Aoki fought through the pain barrier and shrugged aside physicalweakness to claim seventh place in today's Dutch TT - less than 24 hoursafter a crash in practice threatened to rule him out of the race. Althoughescaping without fractures, Aoki suffered a painful blow to the base of hisspine after a dramatic high-speed high-sider crash in the final practicesession. Doctors only passed him fit to race this morning, and he wasunable to use his legs and weight to control the bike. Even so, herecovered from a poor start to move gradually through to seventh place,overtaking other works riders in the process, to gain a top-ten finish andvaluable championshippoints.<p>"I'm exhausted. Because of my crash I couldn't put power through my legs tomove around on the bike and help to steer it. It means I had to doeverything with my arms and shoulders. After about 15 out of the 20 lapshad passed, I could hardly control the bike anymore. But anyway, Ifinished. I got some points, and there are many races left. I rode the bikein standard condition, with no special settings to make it easier. It wasthe best setting we had all weekend, and the tyres were working very well.It was just missing a bit of braking performance. That was my only problem."<p>Ralf Waldmann was forced to withdraw from the Dutch GP following a  heavyfall in yesterday's final qualifying session. The German Modenas rider hasfractured the radius bone in his right arm, where the bone articulates withthe wrist. He is also likely to miss next weekend's British GP, returningfor his home race at the new Sachsenring on July 19.<p>"The fracture is in line, so it's not a huge problem, but there's no wayRalf can twist the throttle and use the brake at the moment," said teamtrainer Dean Miller. "I'd say he's doubtful for Donington, but we'll seehow things look later next week."     <br clear=all><p><center><hr noshade><A HREF="http://www.electric.on.net"        onMouseOver="waxon('home');        statuson('home'); return true;"        onMouseOut="statusoff(); waxoff('home');        return true;"><IMG name=home SRC="../buttons/butt_home_off.gif" ALT="home" WIDTH="140" HEIGHT="32" BORDER="0"></a><A HREF="../sport/index.html"        onMouseOver="waxon('sport');        statuson('sport'); return true;"        onMouseOut="statusoff(); waxoff('sport');        return true;"><IMG name=sport SRC="../buttons/butt_sport_off.gif" ALT="sport" WIDTH="140" HEIGHT="32" BORDER="0"></a><hr noshade></center><p><A HREF="http://www.electric.on.net">http://www.electric.on.net</A><p>&copy; This work is subject to copyright.
