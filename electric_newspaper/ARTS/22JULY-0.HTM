Go see it, you will not bedisappointed.<p>There are 15 works in the exhibition, all are of a high technicalstandard and paint the portrait of Austin and his daily existence. Iparticularly enjoyed "Studio Painting #4", where there is almost avoyeuristic sense as the clues of presence are given, but not evident.The light pouring in gives a sense of life but also adds to thesolitary, introspective nature of the imagery. <p>I interviewed Daryl Austin a few days ago about his exhibition.<p>Two years ago Austin travelled to Europe after winning an EVA award,this resulted in a major re-assessment of his work. After holdingcertain works dear from reproductions and in turn being influenced bythem, seeing the actuality of these great paintings was in some cases areal disappointment. Monet's Cathedral series seemed nothing more thanwhat can be described as wedding cake! Whilst others like Van Gogh'sportraits were very intense and gazing onto Jean Auguste Ingres "MadameMoitessier" in the National Gallery in London, became an exceptional andeven a humbling experience. Austin was amazed at Titians handling ofpaint to describe form, with one brush stroke he could describe a fingerand also leave a wonderful physical surface behind. The coolness anddetached nature of Velasquez work and the analytical nature of David andIngres work has had a profound influence on Austin. The Result of all ofthis was the need to give up on his previous love of pure abstractionand focus on the image as a priority.<p>Many viewers of Daryl's work are puzzled by what they see when they arelooking at the imagery in his latest body of paintngs and drawings. Theyare trying to work out how they are being tricked. Eventhough there aremany clues in Austins work, such as the spectacles, the frame of thecanvas shadowed from behind or the fake photograph behind fake tape, infact many things that are peripheral to the process of constructing thepainting but all necessary in its production are visible. Thesepaintings are about the everyday, about universality, a portrait orperhaps testimony to the artists existence. <p>Austin has observed odd things happening in his studio, the play ofnatural light falling from the window as against the fluorescent lightreflected on the floor. Objects left in Austin's studio by visitorsoften end up in these paintings and in this way the article becomes partof the environment. In the same way, the photographs in his work areoften happy accidents using bad reflected light, with under oroverexposed images. There is this randomness of chance of articlesappearing in the works.<p>With the metaphor of using glasses, Austin quotes Jasper Johns seeingthe rims of his frames as a disturbing experience. Austin found anoticeable visual experience that became very disconcerting whilst hewas in England with the foggy distances, whilst being used to seeing formiles, the crispy clarity of the Australian landscape. The idea ofputting tape over the glasses in some of the paintings is to have a bitof fun, a bit of a joke with the need to wear glasses as an aid tovision and then negating this by impairing the vision with tape. So evenwith all the aids of modern technology we still do not really see.<p>These series of works seem to be about memory and Austin refers back toTS Elliot's Still Point, where the author talks about memory, the spacesthat exist before, afterwards and those that always will. They all existin the same time and point in memory. Here is the key, we see looking atDaryl's work, the back of his painting at the same time as the front,the working tools of trade that helped construct the painting at thesame a finished image all revolving within the same space. Anotherreference point for Austin is the notion of who we are as told in themovie "Blade Runner" (or "Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?"), wherethe androids held fake photographs to prove that they had a past. Asphotography is now such an easily manipulated image via computers, it isno longer as trustworthy a testimony to an event and perhaps paintingnow seems more authentic.<p>Austin is now 11 years out of art school and embarking on a revolvingcontinual ride of self-evolution, creating his own genre. Thesepaintings can be placed as fetish objects, with Austin seeing himself asthe magician. Austin sees possible new elements emerging in his work,such as camouflage netting, which symbolises deception. He will continuewith the nature of objects appearing in the studio and use the realm ofchance to occupy his work.<p>It is great to see a sell-out exhibition in Adelaide, good for Austinand fantastic for the inaugural SALA week. Congratulations on a solid,well thought-out show, it just goes to prove that hard and dedicatedwork always is rewarded.<p><CENTER><hr noshade><A HREF="http://www.electric.on.net"        onMouseOver="waxon('home');        statuson('home'); return true;"        onMouseOut="statusoff(); waxoff('home');        return true;"><IMG name=home SRC="../buttons/butt_home_off.gif" ALT="home" WIDTH="140" HEIGHT="32" BORDER="0"></a><A HREF="../arts/index.html"        onMouseOver="waxon('arts');        statuson('arts'); return true;"        onMouseOut="statusoff(); waxoff('arts');        return true;"><IMG name=arts SRC="../buttons/butt_arts_off.gif" ALT="arts" WIDTH="140" HEIGHT="32" BORDER="0"></a><hr noshade></CENTER><p><A HREF="http://www.electric.on.net">http://www.electric.on.net</A><p>&copy; This work is subject to copyright.
