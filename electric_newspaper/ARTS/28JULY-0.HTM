The photos, which he had been carrying in hisbackpack for over a year as he travelled from country to country, were of Israel's secret nuclear bomb makingfacilities at the Dimona Nuclear Power Plant located in the Negev Desert.<p>With assistance of the parishioners of St John's and the Sunday Times inLondon, Mordechai Vanunu revealed this volatile package of photos to the world, butthe price for Vanunu was high. He was kidnapped from London and Rome by Israel'ssecret police, the Mossad, an act which broke numerous international laws.He was shipped in a crate from Italy to Israel where he was tried in cameraunder Article 99 (a) of the1977 Penal Law, an offence constituting treason and including the "intentto assist anenemy in war against Israel".<p>The trial process was questioned by Amnesty International at the time.<p>Vanunu was sentenced to 18 years' imprisonment, the first 12 1/2 years ofwhich he spent in solitary confinement in a single cell no bigger than acloset with a shower andlavatory. He was released from solitary confinement into the general prisonpopulationearlier this year.<p><B>The Play</B><br>The play Morde is a taut philosophical spy thriller exploring the eventsthat leadVanunu to decide he had no choice but to expose his country's shadowyinvolvement in developing weapons of mass destruction in the most volatileof politicalenvironments - The Middle East - and his kidnapping by Israel's spy force,The Mossad.<p>Weaving deftly between Morde's torture in Ashkelon Prison, Tel Aviv and histormented inner journey at St John's Church in Darlinghurst, Sydney one ofAdelaide'sand Australia's finest actors Syd Brisbane (as Morde), deals with a worldof hidden lies in the search for what is right.<p>If spies can speak a truth they hold a lie and men of religion quibble atmorality, whatsafety in the world is there for those whose lies cloak the ever presentreality ofArmageddon?<p>Suddenly the easy and comfortable distinctions between right and wrong,politics andreligion, love and manipulation are impossible to see - the world of Mordeis one ofshadowy half truths, sentiments and realities.<p><B>The Playwright</B><br>Adelaide Playwright Paul Rees juggles a heady mix of mystery, romance,philosophy,nuclear capabilities, politics and religion which whirl about at a franticpace. Rees,who once worked in Federal politics, has had several plays produced overthe past fouryears. He regularly writes for students at the Centre for the performingArts, he haswritten for Junction Theatre, Urban Myth Theatre of Youth and several playsthroughTheatre Praxis.<p>Rees' playscript of Morde has also been acquired by TropNestProductions (FoxStudios) in Sydney for development into a film screenplay, slated to bedirected byRowan Woods, whose critically acclaimed The Boys was recently released.<p><B>The Show's the thing</B><br>Morde is designed by Nic Hurcombe who captures the time and place of themid-Eighties and the crucifying dilemma of Morde with a striking set whichbreaches the crossroads of decision making.<p>The play is directed by Catherine Carter, and the cast includes SydBrisbane in the lead role of Morde, Patrick Frost, Marlo Grocke, GeoffRevell, and Lucy Slattery.<p>Theatre Praxis was has produced 15 plays it was founded in 1995,  and isthe managing company behind the resurgence of one of Adelaide's betterknown theatre venues the Lion Theatre Bar and Cafe.<br clear=all><p><CENTER><hr noshade><A HREF="http://www.electric.on.net"        onMouseOver="waxon('home');        statuson('home'); return true;"        onMouseOut="statusoff(); waxoff('home');        return true;"><IMG name=home SRC="../buttons/butt_home_off.gif" ALT="home" WIDTH="140" HEIGHT="32" BORDER="0"></a><A HREF="../arts/index.html"        onMouseOver="waxon('arts');        statuson('arts'); return true;"        onMouseOut="statusoff(); waxoff('arts');        return true;"><IMG name=arts SRC="../buttons/butt_arts_off.gif" ALT="arts" WIDTH="140" HEIGHT="32" BORDER="0"></a><hr noshade></CENTER><p><A HREF="http://www.electric.on.net">http://www.electric.on.net</A><p>&copy; This work is subject to copyright.
