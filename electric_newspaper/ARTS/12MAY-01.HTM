Like his late father, Tim Buckley, who died of a drugoverdose in his prime, Jeff was taken from the world at a young age on May27, 1997. <p>	He was, at the time, in Memphis to record to follow up to the hugelysuccessful, and hugely influential, Grace. To be called My Sweetheart, TheDrunk, it never was completed, as his band arrived the day after Jeff tookhis last swim in the Memphis River. On the night that Jeff drowned, he wason his way to meet his band to begin three weeks of rehearsals for MySweetheart, The Drunk. Producer Andy Wallace, who'd helmed the boards onGrace, was to join them in Memphis in late June to record the album, whichhad originally been worked on with producer Tom Verlaine.<p>	Assembled under the guidance of Mary Guibert, Jeff's mother, a new recordis to be released in May - Sketches (For My Sweetheart, the Drunk) is acollection of Jeff's last studio sessions with his band with four-trackhome recordings providing priceless and immeasurable insight into thedirection his music was going. Disc 1 of Sketches (For My Sweetheart, TheDrunk) contains ten tracks from the multi-track studio sessions. Disc 2contains Jeff's last compositions, personal four-track recordings of newsongs and refinements of older songs intended for My Sweetheart, The Drunk.<p>	As the executor of Jeff's estate, it fell to his mother to assist hisrecord label (Columbia) in deciding what to do next - whether to release acompilation of recordings or to simply leave his estate be. She agreed torelease a posthumous album, believing that it was what Jeff would havewanted. But, she did have several sticking points.<p>	First, there would be no posthumous overdubbing. The songs would staywhere Jeff left them, even if a part was missing. Second, the album wouldnot be an overview of Jeff Buckley music. There were good outtakes fromGrace and the Live at Sin-e EP. There were b-sides and pre-Columbiarecordings. Some of those still might come out someday (and if recentreports on the Addicted to Noise website are true, this is almost adefinite) but not now. The last new Jeff Buckley album would be the songshe was working on when he died, the songs he and his band intended torecord in June of 1997 for My Sweetheart, The Drunk.<p>	There were two major sources for recordings of those songs. Jeff and hisband had done three sets of official studio demos with Tom Verlaineproducing, two of which were done in Jeff's hometown of New York City andone in Memphis, where he died. There was a fourth unofficial session, withVerlaine, recorded with Jeff's longtime friend Michael Clouse acting asengineer.<p>Verlaine and the band went back to New York at the end of February 1997.Jeff stayed in Tennessee and continued to work on his songs on a four-trackrecorder. As Jeff was wont to do, new songs were written all the time. Hesent tapes to the band members, so they would be up to speed with him. Hemade a decision to take control of the project himself. Toward the end ofApril, Jeff started making preparations to bring the band and Graceproducer Andy Wallace together in Memphis to record the album he wanted tocall My Sweetheart, The Drunk. Andy would fly down in late-June. The bandwould be there to begin rehearsals on May 29th. Their flight was barelyairborne when Jeff and a friend set out to grab a bite to eat. They drovearound, ending up at the Wolf River Marina to watch the sunset. The band'splane was in mid-flight when Jeff stepped into the deceptively placid waterto cool off with a swim. By the time the plane landed, the Coast Guard andMemphis Police had begun a futile search and rescue mission, which lastedthree days before a tourist found his partly decomposed body in a Memphismarina. Before this grisly find it was hoped that we was still alive,perhaps unconscious, washed up on a shore somewhere along the treacherousriver.<p>	Over the summer of 1997, Andy Wallace and Steve Berkowitz, Jeff's A&R(artist and repertoire) man, mixed the Verlaine sessions for what couldhave been a single CD release in the latter stages of 1997. But Mary,sensibly, didn't want to rush out the album.<p>In the intervening months between that time and the early months of 1998,Columbia Records executives assisted Mary in the time-consuming task oflistening to and preserving the many hours of four-track recordings. Theywere raw and unfinished, with Jeff performing all the parts - tapping themicrophone with his fingertips for a kick drum sound, toying with weirdeffects, simulating various instruments. Unfortunately, even the best ofthem was sonically flawed, especially when compared to the studio sessions.However, they were the blueprints of Jeff's most recent work, part of hismaster plan for My Sweetheart, The Drunk. It is these, amongst otherrecordings that will be able to be heard in May.<p>	Australia was fortunate enough to see this man twice. Fortunately, itappears his legacy will live in, with the promise of new albums to bereleased. First up in this list is Sketches (For My Sweetheart, The Drunk)which is, predictably, amazing.<p><CENTER><hr noshade><A HREF="http://www.electric.on.net"        onMouseOver="waxon('home');        statuson('home'); return true;"        onMouseOut="statusoff(); waxoff('home');        return true;"><IMG name=home SRC="../buttons/butt_home_off.gif" ALT="home" WIDTH="140" HEIGHT="32" BORDER="0"></a><A HREF="../arts/index.html"        onMouseOver="waxon('arts');        statuson('arts'); return true;"        onMouseOut="statusoff(); waxoff('arts');        return true;"><IMG name=arts SRC="../buttons/butt_arts_off.gif" ALT="arts" WIDTH="140" HEIGHT="32" BORDER="0"></a><hr noshade></CENTER><p><A HREF="http://www.electric.on.net">http://www.electric.on.net</A><p>&copy; This work is subject to copyright.
