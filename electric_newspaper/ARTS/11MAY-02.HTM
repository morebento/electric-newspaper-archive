The epoch around 1800 to 1830 saw aflush of literature with the likes of Shelley, Keats and Wordsworth,whilst London was resplendent with buildings designed by John Nash andfurnished with the opulence of Greek, Egyptian & Gothic revivals ofThomas Hope and George Bullock.<p>Regency accurately falls between the years of 1811 to 1820 when thefamed patron of the arts George, Prince of Wales stepped in as Regentfor his mentally disturbed father, George 111. Due to the Prince Regentsinfluence in society of the Arts over a greater period covering hisjourney from Prince to King George 1V, this exhibition extends itself tothe broader era until his death in 1830. A revealing statue in theexhibition shows at first glance a Neo-Classical Sculpture of the ailing"King George 111" 1813 by Francis Chantrey but actually it discloses theweakened spirit of the man who glazes in a dreamy bewildered state.Although the classical clues are there, including the royal insignia andchain of office, this a very personal portrait of a man balanced on aprecipice.<p>Along with the opulence of this period came influential paintings in theguise of early plein air works that were a prelude to Impressionistpainting. This was a case of keen observation producing paintings with afeeling of life, of the coolness in the shadows and the warmth of thesunlight, an extreme contrast to the heavy ornamentation of Hopes'furniture. To illustrate this we firstly see the work by CharlesEastlake "Cypress Trees at the Villa d'Este, Tivoli" 1817 and then byJohn Constable "Sunrise on the Sea" 1820's, that is a study ofatmospheric effects of clouds and sky produced from observations in theopen air at Brighton, England, showing a fresh approach and a recurrentrural theme throughout the Regency. Perhaps the most dramatic ruralpainting in the exhibition is John Glover's "Cattle Resting" 1820painted in London, it is the image of tranquillity, it is by its sizevery overwhelming and thus imposing its senses of idealism on the viewer.<p>The portrait paintings in the exhibition are very descriptive of eachsubjects place in society. "Mr William Thompson" and "Mrs WilliamThompson and Daughter" by and unknown artist, show the dutiful wife whohas just put away her sewing to play with her chid, the clues of theentire of hats and dress assume a middle class status that is confirmedwhen we look at the separate portrait of her husband. This paintingshows a proud man in his study, dressed in Freemasons lodge garb anddisplaying a silver trophy inferring his successes and level of wealthin society. Other works like "Lucy Sarah Sotherton" 1825 by ThomasLawrence, show the real wealth of a young heiress who sits comfortablyand confidently with the inference of her lands stretching out beyondher. The image of this young woman evokes the elegance of the period andthe Regency Style of dress and jewellery as well as portraying thesocial dogmas that are the real messages underlying the work. Thepainter later became the third president of the Royal Academy and itspaintings like this one that illustrates the doctrine of the studiobased disciplined portrait school.<p>Other items of interest in the exhibition that help create the pictureof Regency, are objects from the South Australian State Library'sChildren’s Literature collection. These include an expanding perspectiveview based on the Thames Tunnel and a fascinating game called "The NewGame of Virtue Rewarded and Vice Punished, for the Amusement of Youth ofboth Sexes" 1818, designed to help teach morals to juveniles.<p>Looking at this exhibition as a whole, what stands out is the creationof such an immense variety of objects to represent the revolutionarysocial, cultural and technical changes that were occurring in Britainduring the Regency era. Illustrated with everything from lavishlydecorated table pieces to the simple grace of the painted portrait of"Archibald Trotter of Bush", by Henry Raeburn 1813 Edinburgh, which isan uncluttered rendering of a man in his finest suit, seated against adulled background, the only hint of opulence being his frilled shirt. Itis worth taking the time to look at the eclectic range of items andrealising what a stimulating era this was for the arts.<p><CENTER><hr noshade><A HREF="http://www.electric.on.net"        onMouseOver="waxon('home');        statuson('home'); return true;"        onMouseOut="statusoff(); waxoff('home');        return true;"><IMG name=home SRC="../buttons/butt_home_off.gif" ALT="home" WIDTH="140" HEIGHT="32" BORDER="0"></a><A HREF="../arts/index.html"        onMouseOver="waxon('arts');        statuson('arts'); return true;"        onMouseOut="statusoff(); waxoff('arts');        return true;"><IMG name=arts SRC="../buttons/butt_arts_off.gif" ALT="arts" WIDTH="140" HEIGHT="32" BORDER="0"></a><hr noshade></CENTER><p><A HREF="http://www.electric.on.net">http://www.electric.on.net</A><p>&copy; This work is subject to copyright.
