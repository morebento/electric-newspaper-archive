This was untilrecently, when Bendigo Art Gallery Curator, Karen Quinlan took up theproject of finding out who Goodsir was after a relative made herselfknown in the Gallery.<p>Quinlan then embarked on finding as many paintingsby the artist that she could. This touring show is the result of herexplorations.<p>Agnes Goodsir was born in Portland, Victoria in 1864, she studied Artfor three years at the Bendigo School of Mines and followed this withanother five years study overseas. Goodsir decided to reside in Londonbetween 1908 and 1918 and then lived in Paris in the 20's & 30's. Afrequent exhibitor at the Royal Academies in England, Goodsir quicklyestablished a name for herself as a portrait painter. In 1926, she wasthe second Australian woman to become a member of the Societe Nationaledes Beaux Arts. Then in 1927, she returned to Australia to work for ninemonths and to hold solo exhibitions of paintings at Macquarie Galleries,Sydney and the Fine Art Society's Gallery in Melbourne. Her works werereasonably well received on these occasions but jibes at the decorativenature of her subject matter and that she was a woman, all probablyinfluenced her decision to return to the Latin Quarter of the Paris sheloved and paint where she felt comfortable.<p>Goodsir died aged 75 in 1939 in Paris. Thankfully, her companion andmodel Rachael Dunn (Cherry), then sent back to Australian relatives andfriends, many of the paintings. Cherry feared the outbreak of war andhoped that by sending work back she would assure her companions place inthe Art History books and at the very least preserve these mosttreasured paintings.<p>I would say it is a necessity for anyone studying painting to see thisexhibition, the lessons of paint application and of layered colours arequite overwhelming. Goodsir painted women with an incredible insightinto their souls, they are draped in lavish decoration and in laterpaintings, always looking confident. These images were of the new modernfemale. This is evident in such paintings as "The Cigarette Girl" 1925,where the fashionable idea of smoking as a symbol of independence isportrayed. The heaviness of the shawl around the shoulders of the woman,the delicate nature of the glass lamp, the rough texture of thetablecloth and the fineness of the porcelain cup on the table are allpainted perfectly. In earlier portraits of women, we do not see the sameconfidence, as is illustrated by "Girl on Couch" 1915. Here the subjectis politely sitting side on to the viewer, delicately reading a letter.However, Goodsir's skill is here, the sense and range of colours, thepainterly application to describe patterns on the screen, the dress andpillow seen so full of depth and texture.<p>Works such as "The Spanish Shawl" are just mesmorising, you can almostsense the fabrics texture with you fingertips, the delicate flecks ofcolour in the skin and the stare of the subject are quite captivating.The portrait of "Cherry" 1925, shows the incredibly beautiful dreamyeyes of Goodsir's companion, this painting is drenched in violet andillustrates perfectly the absolute command she had over the use ofcolour. Again we see this skill, only this time with tone in thepainting of "Cherry" 1924, where the subjects' eyes are shadowed andpeering from under a hat.<p>I found this exhibition to be quite exceptional and felt inspired by theskill evident in these works by Goodsir. There are also many quicksketches in the show and other objects such as the medals awarded to herby the Academies, all of which provide the viewer with a further insightto her life.<p>If travelling around Victoria, New South Wales or South Australia andcan find the time to look at these works, I am sure you will be amazedat why this highly skilled and beautiful paintings have goneunrecognised in the Australian Art History books until now.<p>This Regional Touring Show will be in the following Galleries over thenext 12 months:<p><ul><li>Swan Hill Regional Gallery 8 August - 6 September <li>Latrobe Regional Art Gallery 12 September - 18 October<li>Hamilton Art Gallery 31 October - 6 December<li>Riddoch Art Gallery 12 December - 17 January 1999<li>Orange Regional Art Gallery 29 January - 28 February<li>Dubbo Art Gallery 6 March - 18 April<li>Newcastle Regional Art Gallery 24 April - 6 June</ul><br clear=all><p><CENTER><hr noshade><A HREF="http://www.electric.on.net"        onMouseOver="waxon('home');        statuson('home'); return true;"        onMouseOut="statusoff(); waxoff('home');        return true;"><IMG name=home SRC="../buttons/butt_home_off.gif" ALT="home" WIDTH="140" HEIGHT="32" BORDER="0"></a><A HREF="../arts/index.html"        onMouseOver="waxon('arts');        statuson('arts'); return true;"        onMouseOut="statusoff(); waxoff('arts');        return true;"><IMG name=arts SRC="../buttons/butt_arts_off.gif" ALT="arts" WIDTH="140" HEIGHT="32" BORDER="0"></a><hr noshade></CENTER><p><A HREF="http://www.electric.on.net">http://www.electric.on.net</A><p>&copy; This work is subject to copyright.
