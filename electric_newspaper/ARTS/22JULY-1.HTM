SALA week is here, so go out and visit your local galleryfor a visual feast. See Russell Morrison at Hill Smith Gallery, StaffShow at Adelaide Central Gallery, Kim guthrie & Deborah Paauwe (seeseparate review for Daryl Austin) all at Greenaway Art Gallery.<p>SALA was officially declared open on Sunday 19th July by the ArtsMinister, Diana Laidlaw who was sporting a pair of wild shoes made bylocal artist, Deborah Miller. The throng cooked in the Art Gallery ofSouth Australia as the temperature soared, whilst a very nervous localartist, Hossein Valamenesh gave an inspired speech about his ownexperiences as an artist and why he picked Adelaide for his workingbase. AGSA director, Ron Radford gave a brief history of the AdelaideArt scene, which reminded us all of the glory days when South AutralianArtists were at the leading edge of Australian Art.<p><table border=0 cellpadding=3 align=right width=190><tr><td align=center><IMG SRC="24July/hg2307k4.jpg" WIDTH="184" HEIGHT="133" BORDER="0" HSPACE="3" VSPACE="3"><p><FONT SIZE="-1"><B>Russel Morrison, "Breakfast time quarry" at the Hill-Smith Fine Art Gallery</B></FONT></td></tr></table>Russell Morrison<br>"North East West"<br>Hill Smith Fine Art, Pirie St City.<br>10 July-31 July<p>Russell was born in South Australia in 1954 and has been working as afull-time artist since 1979. In his current exhibition he presents uswith 29 works based on trips to Cape York and down the coast of WesternAustralia. The most successful works in the show for me are "BreakfastTime Quarry" and "Ord River". These two gouaches are more believable intheir mark making and description of form than many of the other worksin the show.<p>ACSA Staff Show<br>&<br>Damien Graham<br>Adelaide Central Gallery, Norwood<br>10 July - 9 August 1998<p>Adelaide Central Staff show spans the breadth of talent that theteachers of the school can provide to their students and illustrates thevariety of their personal artistic practice. Of particular enjoyment isRod Taylor's "Study of Back View of Sitting Woman", which shows a goodunderstanding of form and tonal control with an accurate description oflight falling upon the body. This is a move away from the work he isbetter known for, such as the painting of the nude woman wearing bunnyslippers, but I am puzzled by the companion piece to this study"Composition Study for Woman and Storm". This work has outlines ofcrying cartoons embracing the body and is perhaps a feeble attempt atwhat he is trying to portray.<p>Anna Platten presents two studio self portraits. They are in the usualbrilliant style with a few quick lines to describe light entering theroom from a nearby window and the fall of her painting smock, with thefocus of the study being in the more detailed drawing of the facialfeatures. <p>Dianne Longley, who has just set up the printmaking area at the school,exhibits some of her new digital prints. Longley can always be relied onto be at the forefront of technology when it comes to printmaking andwhilst her actual subject matter has changed little over the years, herwork always remains interesting because of her constand hard work at newways of doing things.<p>Lisa Youngs' still life paintings are powerful images, anchored byabstract shapes such as the very vibrant orange table that features in"Pomegranates 2". Trena Everuss works are representations of urbanviews, which after just seeing Ken Searles views of Ballarat at CharlesNodrum Gallery in Melbourne, I cannot help myself but to compare the twoand in fact find Everuss attempts to be the more evocative images.<p>In the Studio Gallery, is a series of 9 watercolours by Damien Graham,which are well executed and are reminiscent of the portraits of youngmen by Steven Cox. These are on the surface quite attractive works,light in their appearance because of their medium but are actually in myview rather unpleasant and dark in their context.<p>Also in the Student's Gallery are rows of sculptures of heads supportedby long posts. These are quite eerie, especially if you find yourselfalone in the corridor with these works. They are interesting masks ofhumanity, each with their own personality. Definitely worth a look at ifyou are visiting the main gallery.<p><table border=0 cellpadding=3 align=right width=175><tr><td align=center><IMG SRC="24July/hg2307k1.jpg" WIDTH="169" HEIGHT="164" BORDER="0" HSPACE="3" VSPACE="3"><p><FONT SIZE="-1"><B>Debroah Paauwe, from exhibition titled "blue room" 1998</B></FONT></td></tr></table>Deborah Paauwe<br>Kim Guthrie<br>Johnnie Dady<br>(See separate review for Daryl Austin)<br>Greenaway Art Gallery, Kent Town.<br>15 July-9 August 1998<p>Johnnie Dady has installed a work at the facade of Greenaway Gallery,dressing it up for SALA week, whilst inside we move through the sell-outshow of Daryl Austins and into the back galleries where Kim Guthriepresents small installations commenting on himself as a regional artistworking in isolation and effected by Australia's current politicalupheaval with Pauline Hanson's, One Nation Party.<p>Born in the United States and a resident of Adelaide since 1985, Paauwepresents 5 large type C photographs in the back gallery, which has beenpainted blue for the exhibition titled "Blue Room". I was particularlydrawn to "Blue Tights" and the general sense of fun and the larger thanlife, saturated colour of these images.<p>Around the Galleries<p>Elsewhere about the state, you can see Karen Genoff's sculptures andAngela Kirby's paintings at Port Dock Craftworks and Gallery, PortAdelaide. The exhibition unfortunately opened at the same time as theSALA week launch at the AGSA on 19th July but it will be on until the 23August, so plenty of time to get there. Kensington Gallery have PeterScrymgour paintings, Jean Kent & John Geyer's underwater photographs anda selection of South Australian Artists works for SALA week.<br clear=all><p><CENTER><hr noshade><A HREF="http://www.electric.on.net"        onMouseOver="waxon('home');        statuson('home'); return true;"        onMouseOut="statusoff(); waxoff('home');        return true;"><IMG name=home SRC="../buttons/butt_home_off.gif" ALT="home" WIDTH="140" HEIGHT="32" BORDER="0"></a><A HREF="../arts/index.html"        onMouseOver="waxon('arts');        statuson('arts'); return true;"        onMouseOut="statusoff(); waxoff('arts');        return true;"><IMG name=arts SRC="../buttons/butt_arts_off.gif" ALT="arts" WIDTH="140" HEIGHT="32" BORDER="0"></a><hr noshade></CENTER><p><A HREF="http://www.electric.on.net">http://www.electric.on.net</A><p>&copy; This work is subject to copyright.
