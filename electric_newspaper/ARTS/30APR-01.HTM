What will I be tomorrow? Whatwas I yesterday?<p>	In "Something Better", Dalpra illustrates his thought patterns as hejourneys and pauses over the image making definite marks to illustratemoments of furious activity before running off and finding another place torest and create a new mark.<p>	Dalpra seems to put a lot of physical and emotional energy into his workand I imagine completely exhausts himself after each image is completed.<p>	Other works in the exhibition seem more circumspect in their mark makingand placement of objects on the canvas like "The blue wonder".<p>	Here we see a more saturated use of colour and careful selection ofrevolving objects around a figure, which co-exists with all its surroundingchaos.<p>	In Galleries 2 and 3 we see the installation of works by German-bornSchulze, better known perhaps by some of South Australians as Daubist,(Daubism it is the practise of obtaining another person's artwork andre-cycling it into a new work of art).<p>	Schulze has a PhD in neurophysiology and clearly he is interested inobtaining a particular manipulated reaction from those that view his work.<p>	He believes in political shock value and still feels that presenting aDaubist view is the best way he can express himself and his true artist voice.<p>	In this exhibition, however, we are presented with a group of vividlypainted, same-sized patterned canvasses that are placed on the wall in anordered repetitive manner.<p>	In the back gallery is "Ant-Robo-Morphic" that is an installation of agroup of ants circulating around a neatly leveled mound of sand.<p>	They are very quietly going about their business and not really worriedabout anything else but what is in front of them.<p>	Perhaps this is a comment an everyday mundane existence and modern life.<p>	As is usual with Manne's work we see some interesting well-craftedsculpture that looks at modern culture and the analysis of human nature.<p>	"Aha!" is a comical sculpture and caught in mid activity as a toy-likenurse looks into the torso of a decapitated Mr. Potato head-like robot.<p>	On the Mezzanine floor we see the first Solo exhibition of Simone Kennedy.<p>	For many years Kennedy has devoted her career to illustration and hasrecently begun to explore her creativity on canvas.<p>		The five paintings presented are competent works that tell the story ofevolution from seed to adulthood, interspersed with these works are theless successful sculptural installations of fabric foetuses suspended inorganza.<p>	I find these destroy the strength of the paintings and the subtly of touchin the compositions.<p>	Kennedy has been seduced by colour but has learnt to use it well as can beseen in "Hybrid".<p>	Her paint surface is smooth and calming and allows the revolution of timeto play out across her images.<p>	"Little Women" is a self-portrait that brings onto the surface text withwords like 'peace' and 'stabiliser'.<p>	This is a reflection on her life as a woman and as a mother, portrayingher fears and fascinations with insects crawling around the image toemphasise mortality and the cycle of life.<p>	The exhibition concludes on 17 May.<br clear=all><p><CENTER><hr noshade><A HREF="http://www.electric.on.net"        onMouseOver="waxon('home');        statuson('home'); return true;"        onMouseOut="statusoff(); waxoff('home');        return true;"><IMG name=home SRC="../buttons/butt_home_off.gif" ALT="home" WIDTH="140" HEIGHT="32" BORDER="0"></a><A HREF="../arts/index.html"        onMouseOver="waxon('arts');        statuson('arts'); return true;"        onMouseOut="statusoff(); waxoff('arts');        return true;"><IMG name=arts SRC="../buttons/butt_arts_off.gif" ALT="arts" WIDTH="140" HEIGHT="32" BORDER="0"></a><hr noshade></CENTER><p><A HREF="http://www.electric.on.net">http://www.electric.on.net</A><p>&copy; This work is subject to copyright.
