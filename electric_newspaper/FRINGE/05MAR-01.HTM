It' s something different to sport yet it often involves the samekind of hand-eye co-ordination, the same kind of energy, the same kind ofskills training, talent, the same kind of commitment. <p>	"But somehow there is something different between sport and art. Withinthe framework of Arts Iare two very distinct categorise: that is, art andentertainment. <p>	"Entertainment tries to provide something that's akin to cerebral massage.It's something that you are encouraged to do when people are stressed, whenthey have had a hard week. It's the kind of work that my Dad says me, 'Rob, Idon't want to have to think too hard, I just want to be entertained'. <p>	"I don't discourage entertainers because that's where I began. I didn'tdiscover art till I was about 25, when I was thrown in at the deep end ofNew Opera South Australia to open the Space Theatre in the Festival Centre.I had no idea that people trained, I came from a tradition of vaudevillemusic halls, in which one simply got up and did it. You learnt fromrecords, you watched your Dad singing, you started to sing at his gigs. Iwas an entertainer and I was an entertainer for a very long time and fromtime to time I am still an entertainer. <p>	"The object of entertainment is to keep people happy. It is not tochallenge them; it is to find those things you believe your audience wantsand to give it to them. <p>	"I believe that art does exactly the opposite. I think that quite often 90per cent of the time,  art ends up entertaining you. But the intent isdifferent. The intent is to use art in the way a scientist would use it, oran engineer would use it, or a challenging architect would use it -  and that is to stir up the mind, toget at the soul , to get at the heart of life and make people think. <p>	"Invariably, when it is truly the intent, art is challenging and deeplydisturbing quite a lot of the time. And if you have experienced art I thinkthat this would be the touch test - you would walk out of the experience in some way changed. <p>	It's an interesting way to view the arts,  in terms of art and entertainment,because it means that a great deal of opera and a great deal of symphonicmusic isentertainment.<p>	"A great deal of those modes that we have learnt to love and seen as thepinnacle of arts set out are, in many cases,  only entertainment. Takeopera sung in in a language you do not understand, which if sung in alanguage you did understand would prove to be a llot of codswallop. Different themes of social moreslong out of date, beautiful costumes, sweet music - which is harmonicallyfamiliar for the past hundred years so it doesn't challenge your ear. It sets out to give a nicenight out. <p>	"Now, there is nothing wrong with a nice night out - there is nothing wrongwith entertainment. It's a fantastic thing to do. In fact, I encourage youto enjoy the Adelaide Festival where you can experience a great deal ofentertainment - in particular the construction on the Plaza betweenParliament and the Adelaide Festival Centre called the Squeezebox. Everynight at 10.30 there will be the greatest accordion-based bands from allaround the world entertaining you for free. It is an opportunity to sit anddrink and dance and talk the night away under fantastic hot Adelaide Summernights. That's entertainment and that's absolutely fantastic. <p>	"You're also going to see another terrific show that has some particularrelevance to health issues and that's a show called 'Circus Ethiopia'. Ithas many, many performances at all kinds of different times to suitfamilies. It's entertainment, it's got a great African band, it haswonderful costumes, you see a beautiful companyof kids from Ethiopia from nine years old to twenty years old who have madecircus theirs because the kids in Ethiopia needed hope. <p>	"It really is a health project in the sense that kids needed to galvanisearound something; they needed to develop skills, they needed something tolook forward to and something that would bind them together in a societythat was becoming increasingly fractured by everything from drought to war,to civil destruction. It's a beautiful show to watch. You will come outrevived and entertained and full of wonder that such terrific kids in suchstretched circumstances are able to give so much joy and pleasure. Ofcourse some of the 'intent' will be about art, it will be precisely thatyou will go away not only with a nice afternoon or night out from thiscompany but you will think about the origins of the company and that too may changeyour world view and that's where that entertainment becomes in my opinion'art' - because it's the desire of that company to communicate some of their great self-worth that'sbeen earned through this work. <p>	"It's a fantastic thing to see. <p>	"So for many audiences, entertainment is absolutely fantastic. When youexperience art as an audience you may come away deeply disturbed. Take forexample The Architect's Walk, by Australian playwright Daniel Keene,directed by Adelaide's Tim Maddock for the Red Shed Theatre. It stars RalphCotteril - fantastic actor - as Albert Speer, the Nazi architect who wasconfined in Spandau prison for 20 years. Speer built a garden and in those 20 years he walked 23,000kilometres  around circularly in his garden and imagined travelling aroundthe world. It is a deeply disturbing show, frightening and horrifying. Ithas phenomenal skills by the actors and the musicians. However I believethat our society at the moment values entertainment over art. I think thatif we are trying to say that the arts are good for our health, we have tobe very careful that we're not just saying entertainment is good for ourhealth. <p>		"Entertainers, essentially, simply capitalise on given values. Artists makepeople think, disturb them, question, be oppositional, say 'this is the wayI see the ills of life or this is the depth or the extreme of passion thatI want'.<p>	"And quite often, people don't want to experience those extremes - dailylife is getting harder and more stressfull. I think that if people aregetting more unhealthy and feeling less well because they are working16-hour jobs and feel immense pressure in all directions - I believe thatwe need artists to remind us what the true values of life are. <p>	"Entertainers won't usually do that. They'll give you a good laugh andthat's fantastic - and in the Adelaide Festival this year are lots oflaughing and lots of good times and you will just do what I do when I singand that is 'blow it out' and be tired and go home and wake up refreshedfrom that big blow out. <p>	"If I don't have a good sing, a really big sing once a month, I startto get physically ill. So if I haven't actually got a gig before a 2000-strongaudience, which is the best blow, I put on the Abba CD and I drive out intothe desert and I scream my head off. So that's important and I hope you doa lot of that in the Adelaide Festival because that's what the big buzz is about. <p>	"But I also believe that we need to cherish the difficult, hard,challenging artists, because they are the ones who are saying don't justsit back and let it flow over you, get moving that gift that we are given,to really chew out what life is really about. <p>	"I believe that if we don't do that we will become a sick society. <p>	"I believe that artists first and foremost, the hard ones, the tough ones,the difficult ones, the ones who remain poor and are quite often calledwankers - I think they are the ones that are the true heros - they are, tome, the living national treasures that must be cherished above all becauseif they get a society to think, to question, to challenge. <p>	"Unless we keep challenging in that way, and arts leads by entertainingpeople, by getting them in and entertaining them but at the same timetwisting that knife every time to say think about this, feel this, feel itdeeply, don't let things skim along the surface, feel it so deeply that youwant to shout or scream or cry or walk out into the night after thisexperience and say I don't know what the world is anymore, this is a hugechallenge. <p>	"When artists in challenge in that way and get the creative muscleflowing, it flows on to science, to engineering, to health, to medicine, toall those otherthings in society. <p>	"Our society is in danger of just trying to aim for comfort because life istoo hard. I've never accepted that. I think you come out more rejuvenated bybeing challenged than you do by simply being satisfied. I think the bestsign of a healthy society will be when people debate, when they talk toeach other, when they value artists who challenge us all the time insteadof only valuing the entertainers. <p>	"Real heros  will never be recognised publicly. They'll have a difficultlife, they may die unsatisfied. But their works actually keep us sane,keeps us healthy and keeps us challenging all those bits of society thatare in danger of going wrong.
