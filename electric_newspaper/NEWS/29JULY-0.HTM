If what you eat becomes you, then manyAustralians may soon choose to look at the fine print on the labels.<p>The Adelaide Forum on Genetically Manipulated Food was told at Burnsidelast night that whether those labels mention theproduct contains DNA of other animals or plants depends on thedecision of Health Ministers meeting in Sydney over the next two days. <p>Last night's attendees were warned DNA modified-crops poised a threat toworld horticultural biodiversity.<p>"We live at the crest of a major genetic experiment," said Bill Hankin,Director of Australian Heritage Seeds. <p>The research scientists are creating what amounts to new organisms whichwill replicate and cross pollinate with normal plant species, altering themirreversibly, Mr Hankin said. <p>Mr Hankin told the meeting that just like rabbits and blackberries, justone "significantly adverse species running wild" could have a big impact. <p>The six multinational corporations, Monsanto, Novartis, DuPont, AgroEvo,Zeneca and Dow - responsible for ploughing resources and money intogenetically engineered food - were accused of threatening the geneticblueprints in nature for the sake of profit. <p>The creation of a "terminator gene" in seeds given to Third World farmersproduces higher yields but then self-aborts sometime after the first cropto ensure continual seed sales, he said. <p>"I think that we really need to ask ourselves why we should be prepared toaccept, as a community, the risks of genetic engineering when the benefitsdo not flow to the community but to the few  corporations controlling thetechnology," said plant geneticist Dr Phil Davies.<p>Dr Davies urged caution with a technology that is "imprecise andunpredictable" and clearly in it's infancy.<p>Dr Kate Clinch-Jones agreed that if modern science could explain merely 3%of DNA, then the risks were unknown. <p>"We do know that the effect of a gene and even the gene itself can bemodified by other genes present and also by environmental factors," DrClinch-Jones said.<p>"With genetically engineered food, all sorts of genetic material frombacteria, viruses and non-food plants are being incorporated into the foodchain. The risk of these being allergenic is unknown and the foods will notbe labelled unless our Health Ministers make a decision on this point sothat you will not known that you're eating something that's beengenetically engineered and you won't know what its been engineered from,"Dr Clinch-Jones warned.<p>Genetically modified foods that we may be eating include all processedfoods using imported soybeans or soybean derivatives such as lecithin, andare present in a huge range of foods including baby foods, bread, breakfastcereals, soup mixtures, ice cream, pasta, biscuits, and chocolate.<p>"We would like to see full disclosure labelling of all foods, not justgenetically engineered foods, just as a matter of principle, and amoratorium on the introduction of genetically engineered foods because theyhaven't been proved to be safe," said a Natural Law Party  spokespersonfrom New Zealand, Guy Hatchard.<p>Bob Phelps, Director of the Australian Gene Ethics Network, said thatgenetically engineered food are part of the industrialisation of foodsupplies, labelling it an 'industry' rather than a science.<p>"If gene-tech foods come into the food supply and we say that they shouldnot come into the food supply, then we must be empowered to look out forown interests and our own safety and decide how we want to spent our fooddollars on the basis of the best knowledge available," Mr Phelps said.<p>Although the conveners of the meeting - The Gene Ethics network and theNatural Law Party - said they had formally contacted many organisations torepresent the industry viewpoint and none accepted, one wildcard did appear.<p>He was the Director of the Co-operative Research Centre of Weed ManagementSystems, Associate Professor Rick Roush, who disagreed.<p>"I don't think there's any health risks with Bt cotton or RoundupReady Soybeans... and I've studied them at length," Prof Roush said.<p>He said labelling of foods may inhibit growers to adopt the technology, andlabelling risked public misunderstanding of the subtle differences betweenminor and major alterations to food.<p>"The public has a right of choice," organiser Vladimir Lorenzon replied.<p>The Gene Ethics Network has its own website <A HREF="http://www.peg.apc.org/~acfgenet">http://www.peg.apc.org/~acfgenet</A>Heritage Seed Curators Association: email <A HREF="mailto:han.HSCA@b150.aone.net.au">han.HSCA@b150.aone.net.au</A> <br clear=all><p><CENTER><hr noshade><A HREF="http://www.electric.on.net"        onMouseOver="waxon('home');        statuson('home'); return true;"        onMouseOut="statusoff(); waxoff('home');        return true;"><IMG name=home SRC="../buttons/butt_home_off.gif" ALT="home" WIDTH="140" HEIGHT="32" BORDER="0"></a><A HREF="../news/index.html"        onMouseOver="waxon('news');        statuson('news'); return true;"        onMouseOut="statusoff(); waxoff('news');        return true;"><IMG name=news SRC="../buttons/butt_news_off.gif" ALT="news" WIDTH="140" HEIGHT="32" BORDER="0"></a><hr noshade></CENTER><p><A HREF="http://www.electric.on.net">http://www.electric.on.net</A><p>&copy; This work is subject to copyright.
