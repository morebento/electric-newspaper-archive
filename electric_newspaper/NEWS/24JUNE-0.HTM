(You can read the full NEMMCO reportat <A HREF="http://www.nemmco.com.au/riverdeter.htm">http://www.nemmco.com.au/riverdeter.htm</A>although you'll need a late version of Netscape. NEMMCO's website is at <A HREF="http://www.nemmco.com.au/nemmco.htm">http://www.nemmco.com.au/nemmco.htm</A> )<p>Monday's Australian quoted unnamed industry sources who believed thedecision to scrap Riverlink was taken by the Olsen Government to soften theAustralian Democrats' opposition to a power sale (see separate story: E-dayfor Democrats).<p>The story said State Treasury officers met with their NSW counterparts onJune 17 - two days after the Lucas announcement of Riverlink's cancellation- to discuss ways of pursuing the deal.<p>Mr Lucas said the story was wrong. <p>He said there had been no meeting since his June 15 statement.<p>Opposition Leader Mike Rann yesterday called on Mr Olsen to explain. MrRann said he had "confirmed with the New South Wales Government that ameeting between Treasury officers, at which Riverlink was discussed, didtake place".<p>Mr Lucas says the scrapping was welcomed by the Government. "It isimportant to stress that NEMMCO's decision was an independent decision," MrLucas said. "SA was advised after it had been made."<p>This would mean a body on which the State had no representation made a $110million decision without telling the State. <p>It also means that SA was denied access to cheap NSW power by a body notresident in South Australia.<p>In his Monday statement, Mr Lucas said any suggestion that SA Treasuryofficials had been involved in discussions to reactivate Riverlink at alater date were "both dishonest and deliberately mischievous".<p>The Electric Newspaper understands that this statement was not drafted inthe Treasurer's office, but was put together with the collusion of twopublic relations practitioners working on the ETSA sale. <p>The PR team comprises Olsen confidant and friend, journalist Alex Kennedy,and a former staffer of Labor Premier John Bannon, Geoff Anderson.<p>At Parliamentary Estimates, Mr Lucas revealed these two have already beenpaid $25,000 for six week's work. Their brief is to counter voterresistance to electricity privatisation.<p>So seriously does the team take its work that it created an incident lastweek, when Australian Democrat energy spokesperson Sandra Kanck wasinspecting the two Torrens Island power stations.<p>These stations are now owned and operated by Optima Energy. They are partof the proposed sale.<p>Ms Kanck had organised a tour through the stations, and a briefing byOptima executives.<p>But when she arrived, the briefing did not commence. There was a wait untilMs Kennedy and a representative of Morgan Stanley arrived. Only then didthe tour and briefing begin.<p>"It was as if the Optima people couldn't be trusted to say anything. Theyhad to have a nanny," Ms Kanck said later.<p>Before Ms Kanck had completed her scheduled briefing, it was cut shortbecause "Alex Kennedy had to go back to the office", Ms Kanck said.<p>The Democrats have already exposed what they say is "another falsestatement" in the State Government's advertising privatisation campaign.<p>The taxpayer-funded brochure titled ‘Electricity Reform: Your QuestionsAnswered' issued shortly after the Premier announced his intention to sellETSA and Optima states "The Auditor-General's latest annual report statesthat ETSA has the highest costs for delivering electricity of allAustralian authorities".<p>When one of Sandra Kanck's staffers combed through the report, he found nomention of that supposed finding.<p>Ms Kanck rang the Auditor-General. He confirmed that there was no mentionof these comparisons.<p>Ms Kanck then contacted the Electricity Supply Association of Australia.<p>South Australia is far from the most expensive. It comes behind Victoria,which has already privatised, and the Northern Territory, which has asparse population scattered over a huge area.<p>"It's disgraceful that taxpayer's money has been squandered to mislead themabout the efficiency of South Australia's electricity utilities," Ms Kancksaid.<p>"If the Government had made a similar statement about a private corporationit would be liable for damages for breach of the Trade Practices Act."<p>Hundreds of thousands of the brochures have already been distributed. TheTreasurer admitted the error of fact when it was uncovered by Ms Kanck,saying the reference had been ‘incorrectly assigned'. The brochure is stillbeing distributed unchanged.<p>So seriously does the Government suspect it may lose the vote onprivatisation that Mr Lucas last week called on MP's not to lock themselvesinto opposing the sale, as National Party MHA Karlene Maywald has alreadydone.<p>Ms Maywald said her constituents in rural South Australia were totallyagainst privatisation.<p>The Premier is scheduled to make a major statement on privatisation inParliament next Tuesday. Liberal sources said yesterday that withleadership tensions running high, Mr Olsen will need to make it acommanding performance to ease backbencher angst about the Government'sdirection and tactics.<br clear=all><p><center><img src="../ads/journos-prides.gif" width=380 height=60></center><p><CENTER><hr noshade><A HREF="http://www.electric.on.net"        onMouseOver="waxon('home');        statuson('home'); return true;"        onMouseOut="statusoff(); waxoff('home');        return true;"><IMG name=home SRC="../buttons/butt_home_off.gif" ALT="home" WIDTH="140" HEIGHT="32" BORDER="0"></a><A HREF="../news/index.html"        onMouseOver="waxon('news');        statuson('news'); return true;"        onMouseOut="statusoff(); waxoff('news');        return true;"><IMG name=news SRC="../buttons/butt_news_off.gif" ALT="news" WIDTH="140" HEIGHT="32" BORDER="0"></a><hr noshade></CENTER><p><A HREF="http://www.electric.on.net">http://www.electric.on.net</A><p>&copy; This work is subject to copyright.
