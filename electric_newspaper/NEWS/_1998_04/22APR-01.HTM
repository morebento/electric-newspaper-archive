Patrick share prices have gone down like the Titanic in anicecube tray since the fight's dragged on.<p>Just yesterday, Woolworths managing director Reg Clairs warned Australianboardrooms that this war on the waterfront, proclaimed by Patrick's anddeclared by Mr Howard and Mr Reith, was going to cost business plenty.<p>Mr Clairs spoke for all of corporate Australia when he said profits were atrisk. In some cases, they're already missing in action. Toyota is facingstandowns and is an innocent victim of the Government's anti-union agenda.Other large corporate players are quietly trying to tell the Government tostick its head in or win the war quickly. This is not largesse on the partof business; it's self-preservation. It's all very well to go busting aunion, but let's not muck up the bottom line.<p>The stock exchange has already suspended trading in Patrick's' parentcompany. This is serious news indeed for the stevedoring company. Itscustomers already have cargo plying the oceans and no certainty of havingthe ships unloaded. The Exchange takes a dim view of companies notdisclosing information vital to its share price. The Australian SecuritiesCommission does too.<p>So in the Patrick's media conference, it was not a smiling chairman,Patrick Corrigan, who looked around the room and said what everyoneexpected him to say: "Appeal".<p>He's going to drag out the battle. <p>So yesterday afternoon, five Federal Court judges, including one inAdelaide, linked up by video-conference and did two things. They put a stayof execution on - they said that Patrick's did not have to re-instate themen until 5 pm this afternoon. Secondly, they gave the company right toappeal before the Full Bench of the Federal Court.<p>Because if the men do go back, Mr Corrigan is in deep shit. <p>"The orders that have been handed down in the Federal Court in Melbourne wefind to be totally unworkable," Mr Corrigan told a news conference almostas crowded as the courtroom had been an hour before.<p>"We're in the position now where we're paying two workforces, whereas wecan only employ one."<p>But that's a risk he shouldn't have gambled on... at least, not accordingto Justice North, who said the company had taken a risk - and lost. He saidPatrick's could have foreseen its sackings would be challenged in the court. <p>So could the Federal Government. To do battle to crush a powerful union onemust have two weapons - the support of the uninformed, and the support ofthe courts.<p>The Prime Minister spent time on 2UE radio in Sydney, uninforming. "Wecertainly didn't conspire to break the law. We certainly didn't conspire inthe sense that it is understood in the law," he said to theincomprehensible audience.<p>The Federal Opposition Leader was equally incomprehensible. He called onthe Prime Minister to call the warring parties together and solve thedispute around the negotiating table. It was almost as if the OppositionLeader thought the Prime Minister was a neutral third party.<p>Justice North was swayed in his decision by the Maritime Union's promisenot to claim immediate wages from the artificially insolvent labor forcecompanies.<p>Meanwhile, the National Farmers Federation is also looking a shotgun in theeye. The NFF has more than its share of union bashers, but there are alsomember cockies and pastoral companies which just want to go farming, notunion-busting. A lot of their affiliation fees (the NFF charges its owntype of union fees) has gone into setting up a non-union, lower-paidwaterfront labor force. <p><center><img losrc="http://www.electric.on.net/graphics/w.gif" src="http://www.electric.on.net/ads/Rob_Roy_3.gif" width=390 height=80 alt="Rob Roy Hotel"></center><p><CENTER><hr noshade><A HREF="http://www.electric.on.net"        onMouseOver="waxon('home');        statuson('home'); return true;"        onMouseOut="statusoff(); waxoff('home');        return true;"><IMG name=home SRC="../buttons/butt_home_off.gif" ALT="home" WIDTH="140" HEIGHT="32" BORDER="0"></a><A HREF="../news/index.html"        onMouseOver="waxon('news');        statuson('news'); return true;"        onMouseOut="statusoff(); waxoff('news');        return true;"><IMG name=news SRC="../buttons/butt_news_off.gif" ALT="news" WIDTH="140" HEIGHT="32" BORDER="0"></a><hr noshade></CENTER><p><A HREF="http://www.electric.on.net">http://www.electric.on.net</A><p>&copy; This work is subject to copyright.
