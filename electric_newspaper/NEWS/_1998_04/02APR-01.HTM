Thencame a State Government commitment to put the money up front and have itpaid back over time. Eventually, it agreed to pay for the bridge withtaxpayers' money.<p>	A group of aboriginal women objected, claiming it infringed on theirsacred beliefs. A subsequent Royal Commission found these claims to befabricated although the Federal Government had by then intervened, stoppingthe bridge under the Heritage Protection Act.<p>	A Federal election and a change of Government later, special legislationwas passed to authorise the bridge. It was the constitutionality of thislegislation which was tested by the High Court here yesterday.<p>	Five of the six judges ruled that the legislation was constitutional, and two 	further ruled that the Federal Government had the power tomake laws which were detrimental to aborigines.<p>	For the federal Government, this is an important judgement. It wants tointroduce other legislation which will affect not just Hindmarsh Island,but the nation as a whole. This is the Wik land rights legislation, whichmay also be detrimental to aborigines.<p>	The Federal Government will now proceed with this legislation.<p>	But in South Australia yesterday, the focus was not on the nationalimplications of the High Court decision, but on local issues.<p>	Tom and Wendy Chapman, the marina developers, and their Westpac bankershave lodged a $70 million compensation claim against the State Governmentfor its tardiness in connecting Hindmarsh Island to the mainland.<p>	"We would like to resolve legal claims by the Chapmans and Westpac againstthe State before construction on the bridge commences," SA Attorney-GeneralTrevor Griffin said.<p>	"We would hope to have work started within the next few months, but thatis largely dependent on the readiness of the Chapmans and Westpac tonegotiate to reach a settlement with us," Mr Griffin said.<p>	The Chapmans, meanwhile, were beaming. "We have finally emerged from oneof the country's longest, silliest, and most expensive political and legalsagas," said Wendy Chapman.<p>	The aboriginal women who brought the action were distraught. "Once again,the legal and political structures of non-indigenous Australian have beenunable to recognise and address indigenous rights and culturalaspirations," the women said.<p>	Meanwhile, at Goolwa near Hindmarsh Island yesterday, the reaction wasdecidedly mixed.<p>	"Who'd want to go there, anyway?" said a stubble-faced fisherman whodeclined to give his name, pointing to Hindmarsh Island.<p>	"It's clapped-out, that (the island) is. Ferry or bridge, I'm staying onthis side."<p>	"We need the bridge," said a shopowner. "This place is dead now andgetting deader. The bridge will help."	"You obviously haven't waited for hours trying to get across on theferry," a woman said as she was driving to pick up her children fromschool. "In the holidays it's hell."<p>	It now seems certain that the bridge will indeed go ahead. Unansweredquestions still remain. What will be done to manage the increased number ofpeople likely to visit Hindmarsh Island and the fragile wetlands of theCoorong and Lake Alexandria? What will be the taxpayer's total financialexposure to build a bridge for what is a private marina development?<p>	And importantly, has all the hurt, the distrust, and the division betweenwhite and black communities, and internally between members of theaboriginal community  over the long and complex legal and social wrangling,really been worthwhile? <p><CENTER><hr noshade><A HREF="http://www.electric.on.net"        onMouseOver="waxon('home');        statuson('home'); return true;"        onMouseOut="statusoff(); waxoff('home');        return true;"><IMG name=home SRC="../buttons/butt_home_off.gif" ALT="home" WIDTH="140" HEIGHT="32" BORDER="0"></a><A HREF="../news/index.html"        onMouseOver="waxon('news');        statuson('news'); return true;"        onMouseOut="statusoff(); waxoff('news');        return true;"><IMG name=news SRC="../buttons/butt_news_off.gif" ALT="news" WIDTH="140" HEIGHT="32" BORDER="0"></a><hr noshade></CENTER><p><A HREF="http://www.electric.on.net">http://www.electric.on.net</A><p>&copy; This work is subject to copyright.
