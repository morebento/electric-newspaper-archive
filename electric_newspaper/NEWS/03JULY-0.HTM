Government strategists were lastnight openly wondering if Mr Ingerson could be found an honourable way toleave. Their answer was no.<p>Mr Ingerson is also unlikely to fall on his own sword. The deputy Premierdoes not even like a shaving nick.<p>Mr Ingerson is facing the first privileges committee in State Parliament'scentury and a half-long history. The committee is investigating whether MrIngerson misled the House when he told an estimates committee that he hadnot made a particular phone call about the appointment of a chief executiveofficer to a horseracing authority.<p>A statutory declaration signed by a prominent Liberal and given to theState Opposition contradicts the Minister's claim.<p>On Wednesday, Opposition Leader Mike Rann asked the Speaker of the House,John Oswald, to rule whether a prima facie case existed that Mr Ingersonhad misled Parliament.<p>Mr Oswald had little alternative. <p>Mr Ingerson's fate now rests with an independent and two Liberals on thatfive-member privileges committee. The Liberals are Graham Gunn, a formerSpeaker himself, and Mark Brindall, a junior Minister whose own career maydepend on his conduct as chairman of the committee.<p>The other members of the committee are two Labor appointees, frontbenchersKevin Foley and Pat Conlon, and the independent conservative Rory McEwen.<p>A senior Minister, who spoke to The Electric Newspaper on the conditionthat he was not named, said it would be in the Liberal's interests for MrIngerson to leave quietly, irrespective of the outcome of the committee. Hesaid there were a growing number of Liberals who thought the same way.<p>Mr Ingerson has been in luke-warm water several times as Minister. Thetemperature is rising, and the water is getting tinged with yellow. Theseare troubles of Mr Ingerson's own making.<p>But the issue is far wider than the fate of one lacklustre MP in a safeLiberal seat. It goes to the heart of John Olsen's Premiership, and to thespleen and kidney as well.<p>It was Mr Ingerson's defection from the Dean Brown camp which delivered MrOlsen the numbers to oust the then Premier and take the leadership in abloody coup two years ago. The Minister said the fall-out from MrIngerson's blundering could sweep away the Premier himself. <p>Already, four Ministers are positioning themselves to be available to takeover the deputy Premiership. The most likely candidate is former HealthMinister and present Government Enterprises Minister Michael Armitage.<p>It is still possible that the Labor Party may have played its cards afraction early. One Labor figure known for his generally astute analysissaid last night that it may have been in the Opposition's long-terminterests to have had Mr Ingerson hanging in the breeze for as long aspossible.<p>The Opposition is concerned that Mr Olsen's increasing erratic behaviour(see separate story) will be steadied by a better deputy, thereforeincreasing support for the unpopular Government.<p>The privileges committee has the same powers to call witnesses as a royalcommission. Certain to be called is the man who was sacked after - thoughnot necessarily because of - Mr Ingerson's alleged intervention, the formerchief executive officer of the SA Thoroughbred Racing Authority, Merv Hill,and the man who blew the whistle on Mr Ingerson, authority chairman Rob Hodge.<p>Mr Hodge's statutory declaration, which dumped Mr Ingerson  into the mire,shows the depth of Liberal in-fighting. Mr Hodge was once a member of theLiberal Party's federal executive, and a vice-president of the State branchof the Party. He is generally seen as a conservative, deeply loyal toLiberal principles, and very worried about the Government's perceiveddirection.<p>That direction came under further scrutiny yesterday (see separate story)with the release a non-scientific study from one of Mr Olsen's economicadvisers, but the Premier's main worry now is now his own survival ratherthan that of his deputy.<p>The Electric Newspaper understands from Liberal sources that if Mr Armitagedoes a reasonable job as deputy, the Party could turn to him to revitalisethe Government's flagging stocks, rather than return to Dean Brown asPremier. Some ALP figures believe Mr Armitage will be a much tougheropponent than either Mr Olsen or Mr Brown, but the outcome of theprivileges committee is not yet certain. Graham Ingerson may yet live on tobungle another day.  <br clear=all><p><center><img src="http://www.electric.on.net/ads/bee.gif" width=380 height=60 border=1></center><p><CENTER><hr noshade><A HREF="http://www.electric.on.net"        onMouseOver="waxon('home');        statuson('home'); return true;"        onMouseOut="statusoff(); waxoff('home');        return true;"><IMG name=home SRC="../buttons/butt_home_off.gif" ALT="home" WIDTH="140" HEIGHT="32" BORDER="0"></a><A HREF="../news/index.html"        onMouseOver="waxon('news');        statuson('news'); return true;"        onMouseOut="statusoff(); waxoff('news');        return true;"><IMG name=news SRC="../buttons/butt_news_off.gif" ALT="news" WIDTH="140" HEIGHT="32" BORDER="0"></a><hr noshade></CENTER><p><A HREF="http://www.electric.on.net">http://www.electric.on.net</A><p>&copy; This work is subject to copyright.
