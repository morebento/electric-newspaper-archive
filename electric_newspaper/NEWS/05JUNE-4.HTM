Hundreds more are injured. <p>              As darkness fell over Eschede in Lower Saxony last night, the		      frantic pace of rescue work gave way to a chilly melancholy silence.              Hundreds of rescue workers were still struggling to uncover the              last carriages of the inter-city express which crashed at 200			  km/h in northern Germany.<p>              The hi-tech, high-speed express was five hours into its morning              journey from Munich and 40 minutes short of its destination in              Hamburg when it came off the rails just outside Eschede at              11.10 a.m. Emergency services said hope of finding more              survivors was ebbing away. "Anybody who is still in there is              dead," said one rescue worker.<p>              By nightfall the rescue teams had retrieved 70 bodies and told              the transport minister, Mr Matthias Wissman, to expect a death              toll of more than 100, surpassing Germany's worst rail disaster              when 102 died in a crash a month after the end of the second              World War in June 1945.<p>              "I've experienced quite a bit in my operations in my time," said              fireman, Mr Andreas Koch. "But I've never seen anything like              this."<p>              "I had to collect body parts, legs and arms from men, women              and children," said Mr Walter Stroettmann, another rescue              worker. "This shakes me to the core."<p>              The precise cause of the catastrophe remained unclear last              night and Mr Wissman ordered an urgent inquiry. "The cause              of this terrible misfortune has to be cleared up promptly and              thoroughly," he said.<p>              Reports that the crash was caused by a car that careered off a              flyover and onto the track were discounted by a local police              official.<p>              Mr Joachim Lindenberg said the car in question was a railways'              vehicle sitting on the overpass when the train crashed into its              concrete supports and brought the structure tumbling on to the              carriages.<p>              The locomotive separated from the body of the train and was              relatively unharmed.<p>              The driver said later he saw no obstacles on the track but			  felt a jolt as he passed under the flyover.<p>              "We're still puzzled as to the cause of the accident," said Mr              Klaus Rathert, head of the district council of Celle.<p>              Mr Peter Muenschwander, of the board of Deutsche Bahn, the              national railways, said that three investigations were being              conducted but it remained unclear why the train had come off              the rails.<p>              First reports put the death toll at 20 with more than 100              wounded. But just before 5 o'clock news came in that rescue              workers had found a number of carriages buried deep beneath              the rubble. Suddenly the death toll was over 60 and was              heading for a 100.<p>              "Children were crawling out of the wreckage looking for their              parents. And so many young people were lying dead, mangled.              It was just terrible," said Ms Christina Meier, a Red Cross              volunteer.<p>              Helicopters whirred over the scene all day, swooping down to              collect each new batch of casualties to be ferried to hospitals              throughout northern Germany.<p>              Huge cranes attempted to lift the twisted metal of crumpled              railway carriages, while orange clad emergency workers              pushed away the rubble.<p>              Too often they found the dead or dying. And as the day              progressed the undertakers were in greater demand than the              ambulances.<p>              The local state government promised immediate financial help              and thousands of people queued to give blood following a Red              Cross appeal.<p>              Flags throughout Germany will fly at half-mast today and              experts hope to establish the cause of the accident soon. <br clear=all><p><center><img src="http://www.electric.on.net/ads/ads_news/agriffiths_optometrist.gif" width=380 height=60 border=0></center><p><CENTER><hr noshade><A HREF="http://www.electric.on.net"        onMouseOver="waxon('home');        statuson('home'); return true;"        onMouseOut="statusoff(); waxoff('home');        return true;"><IMG name=home SRC="../buttons/butt_home_off.gif" ALT="home" WIDTH="140" HEIGHT="32" BORDER="0"></a><A HREF="../news/index.html"        onMouseOver="waxon('news');        statuson('news'); return true;"        onMouseOut="statusoff(); waxoff('news');        return true;"><IMG name=news SRC="../buttons/butt_news_off.gif" ALT="news" WIDTH="140" HEIGHT="32" BORDER="0"></a><hr noshade></CENTER><p><A HREF="http://www.electric.on.net">http://www.electric.on.net</A><p>&copy; This work is subject to copyright.
