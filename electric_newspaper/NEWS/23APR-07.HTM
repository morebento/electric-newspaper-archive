A meeting of all LiberalParty MP's at Parliament House broke up yesterday afternoon withoutmentioning the $96 million writedown in the value of the Electricity Trustof South Australia. Nor did the Liberal meeting discuss the DeputyPremier's apparent negligence in not reading his briefing papers about theissue.<p>	"It wasn't even mentioned, as far as I recollect," said Police MinisterIain Evans as he left the meeting.<p>	"It was a normal Party meeting. Why should it be on the agenda? You'reafter blood for some reason," he told reporters.<p>	Not after it, Mr Evans. We're stepping through it. It's seeping from thewounded career of a Deputy Premier.<p>	On Wednesday, Under-Treasurer Gerard Bradley was asked at by the Economicand Finance Committee when he had told Mr Ingerson about a $96 milliondevaluation in the value of the Electricity Trust of S.A.<p>	According to Mr Ingerson, the first he knew about it was when he read itin the ETSA annual report tabled in Parliament in December.<p>	According to the Under-Treasurer, the information was sent much earlier -in June and July - to the Minister.<p>	So during the Party meeting, Mr Ingerson left the room and walked alongthe corridor to his Parliament House office. There, he prepared a mediastatement. It was the Pontious Pilot defence.<p>	"I acknowledge the fact that Treasury Observer reports for ETSA Boardmeetings for June and July 1997 addressed to the Minister forInfrastructure included references to possible losses," that statement said.<p>	"However, I did not see those reports.<p>	"Standard procedure in my office at that time was that my senior advisersread all ETSA Board papers and minutes as well as Treasury Observer reports.<p>	"My advisers then raised issues of concern with me. However, no advice wasprovided to me on the issue of possible losses," the written statement said.<p>	We are now expected to believe that Mr Ingerson's advisers read thebriefing about a $96 million write-down, and did not tell their boss.<p>	Sure.<p>	We'll find out more about that when the Economic and Finance Committeecalls Jane Cooper, the Minister's former chief of staff, to give evidencenext Wednesday.<p>	But even so, Shadow Treasurer Kevin Foley is not mollified. <p>	"He doesn't read briefings involving a $100 million worth of taxpayerwrite-down, and I will be producing further evidence to clearly demonstratethat he can't blame his staff," Mr Foley told The Electric Newspaper.<p>	"Graham Ingerson's political career is over. He may not yet want to admitthat, but it is over. There is no greater political crime than to blameyour staff for your mistakes. Graham Ingerson was responsible for hisoffice, he was responsible for his staff. <p>	"John Olsen has to sack potentially the State's most incompetent Minister.How can you have the State's second most senior Cabinet Minister who nowadvises us it was his staff's fault."<p>	"How long do you think Mr Ingerson will be Deputy," reporters asked juniorMinister Mark Brindall as he left the Liberal Party meeting.<p>	"The matters of the leadership are matters for the Party," Mr Brindallhinted darkly.<p>	Well, Mr Ingerson won't even be in South Australia when Ms Cooper appearsbefore the committee. The Deputy Premier is going to Europe for 12 days,all expenses paid. By you.<p>	And you can bet he's read the details of his flight times. Even if theyhaven't been pointed out to him by his staff.<br clear=all><p><center><img losrc="http://www.electric.on.net/graphics/w.gif" src="http://www.electric.on.net/ads/Rob_Roy_3.gif" width=390 height=80 alt="Rob Roy Hotel"></center><p><CENTER><hr noshade><A HREF="http://www.electric.on.net"        onMouseOver="waxon('home');        statuson('home'); return true;"        onMouseOut="statusoff(); waxoff('home');        return true;"><IMG name=home SRC="../buttons/butt_home_off.gif" ALT="home" WIDTH="140" HEIGHT="32" BORDER="0"></a><A HREF="../news/index.html"        onMouseOver="waxon('news');        statuson('news'); return true;"        onMouseOut="statusoff(); waxoff('news');        return true;"><IMG name=news SRC="../buttons/butt_news_off.gif" ALT="news" WIDTH="140" HEIGHT="32" BORDER="0"></a><hr noshade></CENTER><p><A HREF="http://www.electric.on.net">http://www.electric.on.net</A><p>&copy; This work is subject to copyright.
