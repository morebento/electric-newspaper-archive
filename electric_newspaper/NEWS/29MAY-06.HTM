TheGovernment is locking itself into an ETSA sale, going so far as "notthreatening" to wack an extra $150 million in taxes or expenditure cutsunless the sale goes through - even though it does not know how much abuyer will offer.<p>The real question now is the attitude of the Australian Democrats. WithLabor standing fast against the sale, the Democrats hold the key to thepassage of the ETSA sale bill. The Democrats are already convinced that along-term lease of ETSA is not a financial option, which means an enormouspressure on the three Upper House Democrats to vote for the Bill or faceGovernment claims that the Party will be responsible for an extra $150million mini-budget.<p>But of course, we knew that.
