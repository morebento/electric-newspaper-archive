They just offend against standards ofcommon decency.<p>	After the show screened on Tuesday night, the Children's Employment Unitreceived calls from parents wanting to know how they could get theirchildren on the program.<p>		Ms Biggins said Young Media Australia believed some of the host's commentson Tuesday's episode were reprehensible.<p>	During the Nappy Ever After segment  involving four-year-olds changing thenappies on lifesize baby dolls, Ferguson says: "Don't worry, you can be asrough with the baby as you like".<p>	At the end of the Advanced Driving School segment involving thefour-year-olds driving little plastic cars around an obstacle courseconsisting of metre-high dummies of policemen, "little old ladies" andlittle girls (and in the process knocking them over, sometimesdeliberately), Ferguson says: "Well, road rage was definitely the themetoday".<p>	During a skit involving Ferguson and a young boy barracking at the footy,Ferguson yells: "Shoot the ref".<p>	Ms Biggins said the purpose of the show clearly was to make money, usingchildren,  "all in the name of entertainment for grown-ups".<p>	"According to the voice-over at the end, all nine participants received a$250 voucher from the major toy store which sponsors the program," she said.<p>	"There also appear to be a number of other opportunities to get brandnames and other program names (including other Nine Network shows) in frontof the audience through 'product placement', and the potential for childrensaying brand names in response to questions."<p>	Meanwhile, the Australian Broadcasting Authority has finally delivered itsdecision on a complaint  from Young Media Australia about an episode ofAustralia's Funniest Home Video Show in May, 1997.<p>	The ABA did not agree with YMA's claim that a segment showing parentsfrightening their children with a chainsaw breached the CommercialTelevision Industry Code of Practice. YMA claimed the segment was not"suitable for children to watch under the guidance of a parent or guardian".<p>	The ABA said it was  " sympathetic to the view that it is questionable forparents to scare their own children in such a way and to tape such a prankagainst their own children,"  but it did not consider that segment harmedor distressed ordinary children watching the program with a parent's guidance.<p>	Young Media Australia will continue to monitor Australia's Funniest HomeVideo Show and any further episodes of Little Aussie Battlers.<p>	Young Media Australia is happy to receive public comments about eitherprogram.
