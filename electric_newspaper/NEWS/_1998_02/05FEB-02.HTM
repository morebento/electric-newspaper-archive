Greenpeace supporters, who cheered when Rainbow Warrior eye-balled the French Navy in the Pacific nuclear test zone, were clearly uncomfortable watching those same pony-tailed commandoes sniping at Port Lincoln fishermen as they legally tried to catch tuna in the Great Australian Bight. <p>As for the Port Lincoln tuna barons, the last thing they wanted was for the Australian public to know that southern bluefin tuna could be fished to commercial extinction by 2020.<p>It suits their interests to have us all believe that tuna is being "farmed" in those huge, circular cages dotted in and around Boston Bay. <p>The idea of "farming" suggests breeding stock being nurtured and raised for sustainable food production.<p>In reality wild tuna is caught along its migratory pathways, often before the fish reach their breeding age, herded into nets, and held captive in feed lots until they can be sold for the best weight and price on the Tokyo sashimi market.<p>The other losers of the tuna war were the mainstream media outlets. Defeated by the logistics of getting to where the action was, (100 nautical miles south of Streaky Bay), the media was once again the compliant pawns of the Greenpeace propaganda machine.<p>Daily satellite phone calls to Rainbow Warrior to be lectured by campaigner, Denise Boyd, on the evils of the Australian tuna fishing industry. <p>"Everything about this fishery is unneccessary. The people who eat the tuna aren't hungry and the people who make the large sums of money aren't poor. The public have a right to know that there is an industry fishing for an endangered species in Australian waters." <p><table align=right border=0 width=260 cellpadding=5 cellspacing=0 bgcolor="#dddddd" hspace=3 vspace=3><tr><td><center><img src="graphics/09Feb_tuna_2.jpg" width=250 height=161>Media crews aboard the Rainbow Warrior.</td></tr></table>The public should also know that Korean, Indonesian and Taiwanese fishers take 5,000 tonnes of tuna every year, and they refuse to abide by the quota allocation system which is supported by Australia, New Zealand and to a lesser extent Japan.<p>It was suggested Rainbow Warrior chose to ignore Asian tuna boats operating outside Australia's 200 nautical mile economic zone because it was easier to target the local fishers who would only retaliate with foul language, fire hoses and hunks of smelly fish bait. <p>While Greenpeace sought to control the media coverage, supplying their own video of inflatables snapping at the hulls of tuna boats in a deliberate attempt to scare-off the fish, they hadn't factored-in Brian Jeffriess, the no nonsense boss of the Tuna Boat Owners' Association. <p>From day one Jeffriess branded Greenpeace activists as "international thugs" committing acts of "piracy on the high seas." <p>Heady stuff but ironically Jeffriess' comments were given some credibility by the T.V. news video supplied by Greenpeace. It wasn't until much later that Jeffriess made available video from the handy-cam cameras aboard the tuna boats, and once again Greenpeace was shown up as the aggressors.<p>Video tape in hand Jeffriess marched off to the Federal Court demanding an injunction to prevent further harrassment of the fishing fleet by Greenpeace inflatables<p>By then Rainbow Warrior had left the scene and the Federal Court judge was left pondering the Greenpeace assertion that his court did not have jurisdiction outside Australia's 12 nautical mile territorial zone. <p><table align=right border=0 width=260 cellpadding=5 cellspacing=0 bgcolor="#dddddd" hspace=3 vspace=3><tr><td><center><img src="graphics/09Feb_tuna_3.jpg" width=250 height=164>Rainbow Warrior Captain Derek Nicholls.</td></tr></table>As they say the case is continuing, with one tuna boat owner demanding up to $4m compensation for fish lost during the protest action. <p>Rainbow Warrior sailed on to calmer, friendlier waters at Kangaroo Island, where locals are struggling to stop tuna cages from being installed in the pristine waters between Penneshaw and American River. <p>Islanders are concerned that tuna cages attract sharks and deposit huge amounts of nutrient rich excrement and fish food waste onto the sea floor.<p>There would also be the potential for dolphins and sea-lions to be caught up in the cages' predator nets close to the island's most popular beaches.<p>Locals maintain the clean, green seas of Kangaroo Island are far more precious as a tourist asset than a feed lot for the tuna fishery which appears to have a limited shelf-life.<p>That debate will be decided by the Development Assessment Commission in the next few weeks, and Islanders have lodged almost 200 written submissions saying "No" to tuna cages.<p>The Greenpeace warriors have sailed east in search of new, worthy causes. Local conservationists are wondering whether the "tuna war" has undone years of hard work, trying to build trust and communication between greenies and hard-nosed fishermen who share a common interest in protecting and harvesting one of the Southern Ocean's most impressive predator fish. <p><hr noshade><p><A HREF="http://www.electric.on.net">http://www.electric.on.net</A><p>&copy; This work is subject to copyright.
