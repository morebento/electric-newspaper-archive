The result: a battle of wills, wheels and unlikely alliances. Depending on who you talk to, the last shot has either just been fired, or the final battle has just begun: a battle, naturally, for ultimate survival.<p>There are three main factions to the battle: the traditional taxi companies; the traditional hire car companies, who deal in weddings, parties, funerals, indeed anything requiring an elderly, but stately, Jaguar or Bentley; and finally, the newer hire companies which have moved aggressively into taxi territory.<p>Back in 1991, there were about 80 hire cars serving Adelaide. This was the industry of weddings and Bentleys. Today, according to Bill Magoulianis spokesman for the Licensed Chauffeured Vehicle Association, there are 1000 hire cars. Bill Magoulianis believes he represent the bulk of the industry, but certainly not those operators moving into the taxi ranks.<p>The new arm of the industry hasn't been content to beat the traditionalists to the altar, so to speak, nor to bowl along in Bentleys. Companies such as Adelaide Impressions and Krystal Koach have introduced Adelaidians to the splendours of stretched Ford LTDs, with their acres of metal, mirrors and bordello red velour.<p>At first these companies carved something of a niche market for themselves, virtually creating the Saturday night Hindley street limo cruise. For at time the newcomers were satisfied to consolidate this trade,  but recently the Koaches have crept into other fields.<p>Steve Laybourn Smartcar doesn't deny his company has been working in taxi territory. He says Adelaide has a taxi shortage and there is a demand for his service.<p>"We should be able to give the consumer a choice. It should be the consumer who decides, not us. Consumers should not be forced into a taxi."Being bundled into a taxi is what has the hire cars owners really worried. At a rally protesting the Government's new taxi and hire car regulations, the consumer's rights line was being pushed hard. <p>One driver said to a passerby,"what would you rather have pick you up from the airport...a plastic Commodore or Falcon, or that beautiful 1972 Jaguar over there". Vested interest was declared. He was the Jaguar owner. In fact he probably owned two old Jaguars: one to drive whilst the other was being repaired.<p>Reliability, quality of services and fairness are, according to the taxi industry, the Licensed Chauffeured Vehicles association and Minister for Transport, Diana Laidlaw, the driving forces behind the recent changes. Plastic a new FalcoMagadore maybe, but at least the airconditioning works...during summer.<p>The Hire car companies doing pseudo taxi work - defined as more than 40,000 kilometres per year- will now have to pay a thousand dollar a year fee to cover compulsory inspections. They will also have to conform to a new taxi based fare structure.<p>It is the age and size of vehicles allowed to do this taxi work that has the hire car owners denouncing the new regulations as against Liberal party policy.<p>"Its anti-competitive", Steve Laybourne says. Forcing us into cars with a 2.8 metre wheelbase pushes us into a category of car that isn't competitive."<p>In practical terms, the only cars fitting the bill on the Australian market, without heading into a Mercedes or BMW dealer, are the South Australian produced Holden Statesman deVille / Caprice, or the Victorian Ford Fairlane / LTD.<p>"It will just cost us too much...you're talk at least $45,000 to buy the car. We can't afford that." said Mr Laybourne.  Buying a chief executive's hand-me-down Holden won't be an option either. Cars will have to be less than 3 and a half years old, making the second hand option economically marginal.<p>The classic cars are not about to be cleansed from the streets. Operators can still offer a vintage or specialist car service, providing they convince the Passenger Transport board they have a viable business plan and pay a 200 dollar a year accreditation fee. The old timers will also not be allowed to go over the 40,000 km per year limit.<p>To Bill Magoulianis, who ironically,  is now the owner of the hire company Steve  Laybourne originally started, is absolutely behind the changes.<p>"Its the taxi drivers who've made the big investments. They've paid about 150,000 dollars for their taxi plates, why should they have to compete with a hire car that paid a few hundred dollars for theirs?"<p>South Australian Taxi Association head, Maurice Barclay, is happy with the changes, "Its now a level playing field, which is all the taxi industry was asking for". <p>Mr Barclay says the taxi industry is also working on some "exciting initiatives", such as shared taxis to overcome shortages at times like New Year.<p> Sharing a taxi with New Year revellers?! For the same reasons taxis generally have vinyl seats, indeed wall to wall and floor vinyl, sharing a taxi with a New Year stranger might not be a good way to start what remains of this millennium....unless of course you've gone out in vinyl......In the mean time, good luck with finding a taxi in Adelaide on a Friday night.<p><hr noshade><p><A HREF="http://www.electric.on.net">http://www.electric.on.net</A><p>&copy; This work is subject to copyright.
