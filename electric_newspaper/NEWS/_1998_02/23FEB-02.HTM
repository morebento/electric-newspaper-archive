True to her usual feistyform, the mayor's initial reaction to the Government's policy backflip wasone of outright hostility.<p>"I felt shock and I felt horror and I felt they were a pack of bloodyliars." That was on Tuesday. Today, the mayor says she is feeling better.<p>"Having calmed down, what alternative have we got? I mean, I have to listento rational discussion," she said.<p>It is worth remembering that Joy Baluch has only just finished nursing hercity through the protracted and painful business of the Australian Nationalsale. While the subject of memory is at hand, no-one in Port Augusta hasforgotten last December's announcement by Optima of the loss of 20 jobs atthe power station.<p>Who, facing such odds, helped change the mayor's mind? The credit belongsto Optima executives, the Minister for Human Resources, Dean Brown, and thelocal Member for Stuart, Graham Gunn.<p>There is a lot at stake for Port Augusta in any sale or lease of ETSA andOptima.<p>The northern power station provides about 180 jobs.<p>As in most regional cities and towns, there is not exactly a surfeit ofjobs in Port Augusta.<p>Some people are arguing that the northern power station is the mostvulnerable of any of the State's generating facilities to a 'run-down'scenario.<p>In other words, a private investor finding Port Augusta old, uncompetitive,and too expensive to bring up to standard, simply allows it to run down.<p>For the sake of argument, that investor may choose to import power from oneof its interstate facilities, buy power from another private power player,or put the money into upgrading other South Australian stations.<p>Mayor Baluch claims on figures shown to her by Optima, Torrens Island isthe facility most vulnerable to vagaries of the national electricity grid.<p>To an extent, ETSA sources confirm her view, but also say part of PortAugusta is not long for this world.<p>How can this apparent contradiction hold true?<p>Compared with Torrens A power station, Port Augusta is a model of modernity- that is, with the exception of the old Playford B station, which despitehaving been patched up is not expected to soldier on for more than a fewyears.<p>The thing to remember is that there are two stations in the northernfacility: Augusta and Playford B. Augusta is the efficient station, buteven it may have a long-term blot on its horizon. Efficient as it is,Augusta burns second grade fuel.<p>This brings up the question of Leigh Creek and the coal it supplies to PortAugusta.<p>Leigh Creek coal is brown coal. It is relatively dirty and relativelyenergy inefficient. However, it fires the northern power station wellenough, because ETSA installed expensive purpose-built German boilers forthe task. <p>But what is a private operator some years down the track, and faced withrepairing those hideously expensive German boilers, decides it is not worththe expense? That's not likely to be done at a place using expensiveequipment to burn poor fuel.<p>In fact, apart from distilling the oil from coal, there's not much else onewould use Leigh Creek coal for, apart from fuelling a power station. NoPort Augusta, no Leigh Creek?<p>The Government should not yet too happy about Mayor Baluch's conversion onthe road to Gepps Cross. Saying, as she does, there is "no alternative butto support the Government" is hardly a ringing endorsement. Her support isconditional.<p>Joy Baluch also believes Professor Fred Hilmer, author of the NationalCompetition report and spiritual father of the integrated electricity grid,should "line up next to Pontius Pilot".<p>Number one on the mayor's list of conditions is the retention of jobs atthe power station. There is a 'no forced redundancy' clause in ETSA workagreements, but that carries through only to December. Premier Olsen hasconsistently maintained there will be no forced redundancies through thesale of ETSA and Optima. <p>The unions remain unconvinced, and as they told ABC television news onWednesday, unless the redundancy clauses are improved, they will pull theplug on power.<p>Joy Baluch's other big condition revolves around a proposed magnesiumplant, for which Port Augusta is apparently the preferred site. That plantis subject of a feasibility study, expected to finish in March.<p>Should the plant go ahead it will be a $250 million investment , creating480 jobs. What effect, if any, the possible sale of the northern powerstation would have on the viability of a magnesium plant remains unclear.The lack of clarity is Mayor Baluch's worry.<p>The mayor's reluctant support for selling ETSA and Optima doesn't mean allis well for the Government. There's the voting public of Stuart to bereckoned with. Joy Baluch claims a couple of electricity workers havecalled her to say, "Whatever you do, we are behind you". These may be theonly two votes, in Port Augusta at least, on which sitting Member GrahamGunn can count.<p>Until recently, Mr Gunn was saying he's fought the good fight for the lasttime; it was his turn to drift off to the land of directorships. Mr Gunnchanged his tune in recent days and is now looking at staying. <p>Selling ETSA, contrary to Government policy at the last election, will makethe next election perhaps the most difficult of Graham Gunn's career.<p>According to Mayor Baluch, Mr Gunn was going to start the process of hisre-election by making sure that everyone in Port Augusta gets a copy of thePremier's speech to Parliament announcing the sale.<p>"Bugger that," said the mayor, "I told him (Graham Gunn) I just want apamphlet with dot points."<p>Labor came close to winning Stuart at the State election last October. MrGunn holds the seat by 1.6 per cent and it is now the most marginal countryelectorate. It can't be too difficult a task for Labor Leader Mike Rann toconvince the people of Stuart that selling the northern power station iscontrary to their best interests. How much privatisation can one town bare?<p>In fact, the only person who is not likely to suffer any great pain out ofall this is Mr Rann. Consider just a few of the possible scenarios. If theDemocrats cave in over a total sale, then that's good for Mr Rann - fromLabor's viewpoint, the democrats got far too many primary votes in the lastelection. If John Olsen fails to get a sale and goes down the path of alease, a course for which the Government says it doesn't need Parliamentaryapproval, then that is good for Mr Rann too. Mr Rann can then say that notonly has John Olsen broken his promise, but has ignored the express will ofParliament.<p>Both Mike Rann and Mike Elliott can argue they have a mandate to block theprivatisation of ETSA and Optima, having run anti-privatisation/outsourcinglines during the election.<p>Unfortunately John Olsen can't do the same because(he says) he didn'trealise he was going to sell the State's power facilities until after theelection. Oopsie, but look on the bright side - perhaps we won't have tolisten to the dreaded M word much during this business.<p>And even if the worst comes to pass and we say Aloha to ETSA, will Labor bevery upset? Not according to senior ETSA sources, who say that some ALP MPsare in favour of electricity privatisation. <p>Whatever the long-term merits or perils of selling our power facilities,the Government seems right about the positive impact of a sale on theState's Budget (in the short to medium term, anyway).<p>And who will be paying the pain for all this?<p>John Wayne Olsen, of course.<p>Mike Rann should remove all the pins from his Ollie voodoo doll immediately.<p>After all it has been through, and all it's about to do, it deserves areally big kiss.<p><hr noshade><p><A HREF="http://www.electric.on.net">http://www.electric.on.net</A><p>&copy; This work is subject to copyright.
