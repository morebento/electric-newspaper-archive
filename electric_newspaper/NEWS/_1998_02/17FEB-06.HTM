The main man is on trial, and the charge is obfuscation.<p>	For two years, John Olsen has denied on a stack of transformers that hewould not sell South Australia's electricity generating infrastructure, norits distribution arm.<p>	During the election, he denied it three times.<p>	Yesterday, the cock crowed.<p>	Into the room walked the Premier, and he took his place at the dock,flanked by the euphemistically-titled Minister for Government Enterprises,Dr Michael Armitage on his right, and the Treasurer, Rob Lucas, on his left.<p>	Clearly, this little black duck needed support.<p>	The Premier announced he will sell both the Electricity Trust of SouthAustralia and  Optima, and if he cannot convince Parliament to agree to hislegislation authorising the sale, he foreshadowed that he would find a wayaround the democratic process and do it by some other means.<p>	"Things have changed since the election," Mr Olsen said. "new informationhas come."<p>	Things have indeed changed since the election. It is over. Voters can blowa fuse if they want - the next poll is three and a half years away. <p>	Had he lied during the election campaign, asked a reporter.<p>	"That's offensive," said the Premier; some in the room were unclearwhether he referred to the question itself, or to the obvious conclusion.<p>	Mr Olsen may not have told the full truth during the election campaign. Heclaims now that information virtually just to hand clearly puts the casethat he should flog off the power stations and  transmission lines.<p>	In two years, we will be buying our power from a foreign-owned company. 		"It's not his to sell," said union official Bob Donnelly. ""It belongs tothe people of South Australia.<p>	"This is terrible, terrible," he said. <p>		The unions will be meeting at 8.30 this morning (Wednesday) when thecurrent workforce will be told what to expect. Using water managementprivatisation as a model, they can expect to be laid off, re-employed bythe new owner for less money, or left in limbo.<p>	The State Opposition, caught by complete surprise, failed to capitalise onthe back-flip. By late afternoon it had not yet managed to send a responseto all media.<p>	Yet Mr Olsen's announcement yesterday was hardly a shock. <p>	The Premier admitted that Cabinet had been looking at the sale sinceDecember last year. He would not admit that it was on the agenda before theState election, but then it took the Church 355 years to admit its cover-upin the earth-revolves-around-the-sun affair.<p>	Consider this: Mr Olsen ruled out privatising ETSA before and during theelection. Today, he asked us to believe that some 'consultants' (who hewouldn't name) had magically appeared like the Three Wise Men to say theybore glad tidings. ETSA had to be sold. Circumstances had changed since MrOlsen went to the people seeking a second Liberal mandate to govern. MrOlsen would be financially irresponsible if he didn't allow himself to beconverted.<p>	The Premier did not say how much these 'consultants' had been paid,although they would probably not have accepted frankincense and myrrh.Today's Wise Men take their payment in gold.<p>	Does the sale of ETSA make economic sense? <p>	On the one hand, the Premier is asking us to believe that six months ago,it certainly did not. He says that now, changed circumstances mean that itdoes. <p>	The flaw in this argument is that circumstances have changed hardly onevolt since the election. <p>	Further, Mr Olsen is asking us to believe that he was not aware of these'changes' until December. If this is true, then the board of ETSA must havebeen sitting in a blackout over the past 12 months.<p>	Even if things have suddenly 'changed', what Wise Men can say that withinsix months after the eventual sale, circumstances will not change again andmake public ownership once more advantageous.<p>	And yet it is hard to argue that the sale would not be in SouthAustralia's short-term interests. SA is badly in debt, and despite - somesay because of - Government policies, the economy is performing so badlythat the debt is difficult to service.<p>	Selling ETSA will reduce that debt significantly. No-one's talking firmasking price, but it will make a significant dent in the $2 million SA nowpays every day in loan repayments.<p>	On the other hand, why would a private energy company buy ETSA and Optimaif they weren't expecting to turn a quid? If the shareholders or owners ofa private company can make money generating and supplying electricity, whycouldn't the Government and its shareholders - the public?<p>	Expect the answers to these and other questions to be force-fed to us inthe coming months. The Wise Men will now be replaced by the Witch Doctors.A 1300 information line is being set up to dispense the Governmentmedicine. A taxpayer-funded public relations campaign has already beenplanned to neutralise the expected community backlash.<p>	Meanwhile, Mr Olsen is still spinning the same sorts of lines he didduring water management privatisation - non-specific guarantees that theconsumers' interest will be looked after, a community committee to includesocial welfare groups about the implications, and supposed subsidies to thenon-urban sector.<p>	The sale of ETSA and Optima is a gutsy decision. No-one will ever be ableto determine if it was the right decision (because the evidence will changeas the years go on), but on the face of it, it has certain advantages.<p>	One of these is the length of time until the next election.<p>	"Are you worried about obliterating Playford-ism in this State," TheAustralian's correspondent, Matt Abraham, asked the Premier.<p>	And Mr Olsen coyly smiled. Dr Armitage smirked. Mr Lucas, perhaps moreconscionable, looked up to the ceiling.<p>	Ministers have discussed this sale just twice before today's announcement.Even the proposed Wine Centre has been before Cabinet more often than that.That is a measure of the Government's Whitlam-esque 'crash or crashthrough' philosophy to important issues of State. <p>	Some years ago, the then Premier, Dean Brown, was at a media conferenceannouncing the privatisation of S.A. Water.<p>	At his side then was the Infrastructure Minister, John Olsen.<p>	In a few years, the good doctor, Michael Armitage, may rememberyesterday's media conference in a similar way.<p>	Meanwhile, the question remains - when did John Olsen see the vision ofprivatised electricity, and how much gold will we pay to the Wise Men?<p><hr noshade><p><A HREF="http://www.electric.on.net">http://www.electric.on.net</A><p>&copy; This work is subject to copyright.
