Prayers and  aformal apologywere extended on behalf of the Anglican church, followed by an expressionof absolution by Aboriginal bishop Arthur Malcolm and Torres Strait IslanderBishop Ted Mosby.<p>A flame was taken from a candle representing the Holy Spirit, and used tolight someleaves - smoke being the Anglican symbol of rising prayer.<p>"While the smoke is rising, the three of us will wash each other's feet,which will be followed by a Eucharist service," Archbishop Rayner said.<p>Archbishop Rayner had spoken to the General Synod earlier in the week abouttheimportance of symbolism in society, socially and politically. He criticisedPrime MinisterJohn Howard for recognising symbolism as fair reason for Australia's changeto a Republic, and yet not fair reason for a reconciliated Australia.<p>Meanwhile, Australia’s Anglicans have called on the nation to avoid racialviolence byseeking to resolve Native Title arguments through reconciliation and toavoid a federal election on race.<p>"We must not have an election based on race," Archbishop Keith Rayner toldreporters in Adelaide. <p>"The consequences for Australian life if there was a race-based electionwill be very serious," he said.<p>Archbishop Rayner expressed his supportfor the use ofsuch alarming headlines as "blood on the streets" in relation to the Bishopof Bathurst ,Bruce Wilson’s address to the Synod.<p>"I want to say to the Government there is still action which needs to betaken to get the parties together in a spirit that really recognises whattheir concerns are," he said.<p>"I entirely agree with Bishop Wilson that we must not have an election basedon race," he said.<p>Describing areas of rural NSW as 'under siege', Bishop Wilson told delegatesthe number of race riots and violence in the area already indicated therewas a very high level of tension.<p>"If there is a federal election based on a racial issue like the Wikten-point plan there is no doubt there will be blood on the streets of NSW,"Bishop Wilson said.<p>"“Take a drive through much of outback rural NSW and have a look at the waysshops have to protect themselves ... that is indicative of a community wherethere is a great deal of tension and the potential for violence."<p>Archbishop Rayner said the Anglican church had apologised verbally, and inaction by creating a special place in it’s equivalent of the federalparliament for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander delegates - includingtwo indigenous Bishops.<p>"We have show the spirit of reconciliation required by the gospel movesthrough this church in word and deed, and I call on all Australians to adopt Christian spirit of reconciliation towards indigenous Australians,"Archbishop Rayner said.<p>The comments came as the Synod passed a lengthy series of sometimes complexmotions which included a call on Prime Minister John Howard to reconsiderthe issues raised by the Senate amendments to the Government’s Native TitleLegislation. <p>In an afternoon dedicated to indigenous affairs, the Synod:<ul><li> Created a special class of indigenous delegates to Synod,<li> Created a special representative council for indigenous Anglicans - calledNATSIAC (the national Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Anglican Council),<li> Called on the nation to seek an honorable, decent and worthy compromise inthe issue of native title.<li> Stated, amongst other things, support for sensitive consultation in thearea of Native Title, such consultation dealing "carefully with theexpectations, aspirations, fears and insecurities of all parties",<li> Urged Australians "to seek an honorable, decent and worthy compromise inthe issue of native title",<li> Told Anglican organisations and agencies to foster reconciliation in theirrespective areas of operation,<li> Requested Prime Minister John Howard to "reconsider the issues raised bythe Senate amendments to the Government’s Native Title Legislation" and "torevisit these issues and hold urgent discussions with all stakeholders".</ul><p>The General Synod also passed a  motion affirming that Christians mayconscientiously believe that theordination of women to the priesthood and to the episcopate is eitherinappropriate or appropriate was passed by The motion was in accordance with the prevailing mood of Synod this week -one that encouraged unity whilst recognising that on some issues there was adiversity of views.<p>The motion was moved by the Rev Dr Robert Doyle of Sydney and was secondedby Dr Muriel Porter of Melbourne.<p>Referring to the ordination of women as priests and perhaps sometime in thefuture as bishops, Dr Doyle said "A problem for manyof us is that of conscientious objection to these developments." <p>However, he said, "In our safeguarding of conscientious objection we oughtto avoidplacing restrictions on the kinds of judgements made by synods, bishops,parishes and rectors."<p>Dr Porter, who earlier in Synod moved the motion dealing with the questionof the ordination of women as bishops, said she had "great pleasure inseconding this motion". <p>"We need to celebrate and honour our diversity and avoid excluding people,"she said.<p>The full text of the motion is as follows:"This synod affirms that a Christian conscience ought to be bound by HolyScripture, as being the ultimate rule and standard of faith, and the creedsand articles of the scriptural faith of the Church."<p>"It also affirms that Anglicans who conscientiously believe that theordination of women to the presbyterate and to the episcopate isinconsistent with the teaching of the New Testament along with those whoconscientiously believe it is consistent stand within the FundamentalDeclarations of the Constitution of The Anglican Church of Australia anddoctrine of the Book of Common Prayer and the Thirty-nine Articles."<p>The political operatus of the Anglican General Synod with its social andpolitical debateregisters the Anglican Church's determination to impress on the widersociety the issues with which its internal community is coming to terms.<p>Like theConstitutional Convention, it is possible that it is very relevant as a reflection of a microcosm ofviews in society.<p><hr noshade><p><A HREF="http://www.electric.on.net">http://www.electric.on.net</A><p>&copy; This work is subject to copyright.
