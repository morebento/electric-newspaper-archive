"Now we have to say it wasn't. We're losing credibility outthere."<p>Treasurer Rob Lucas yesterday announced Riverlink would not go ahead, adecision which will have enormous implications for the proposedprivatisation of ETSA and Optima.<p>"Maybe it's better not to go ahead with it. We don't know. We haven't gotany more info than you have, which I bet is bugger all," the Minister said.<p>Riverlink was to provide power from New South Wales into the SA grid. Itsscrapping means the Government will now have to consider other proposals,including keeping the older of Port Augusta's power stations on-line, andupgrading with either public or private capital the Torrens Island stationin northern Adelaide.<p>"The Government has received advice from its Electricity Reform and SalesUnit that alternative options were available to ensure that SouthAustralians would not suffer major power shortages in the peak days of(next) summer, as predicted would occur without Riverlink," Mr Lucas saidyesterday.<p>The decision to build Riverlink was taken before the Government announcedits intention to sell ETSA and Optima.<p>Mr Lucas said that within the preparation for sale process there had been a‘reappraisal' of several assumptions on which the NSW-SA application wasmade. He said after the Government had decided to build Riverlink, two NSWgenerating companies had withdrawn generating units from service.<p>The National Electricity Market Management Company, which was behind themove not to proceed with Riverlink,  said the interconnector would haveprovided more benefits to the public than boosting internal SA generatingcapacity or upgrading the existing link between SA and Victoria.<p>But it said Riverlink would have created an unfair monopoly. The line'sowners, ETSA and Transgrid, would have been able to set prices on powercarried on the line.<p>Riverlink had been a controversial project from the start. The AustralianDemocrats - whose Energy spokesperson, Sandra Kanck, will visit TorrensIsland this week as part of her investigation to decide whether theDemocrats will support privatisation - had serious reservations aboutRiverlink. Conservationists and scientists were also concerned about theline's route, which was to have disturbed and damaged one of the last fewremaining large areas of undisturbed mallee bush.<p>But Riverlink was more than a transmission line. It was also part of anintegrated plan to provide cheap and secure power to SA. The decision toabandon the project will increase the value of ETSA and Optima. <p>"That's part of the problem we're facing," the Minister said. "There's animpression that we're lumbering from one decision to the next, that we saythe economy's right one year and then say we have to put taxes up sixmonths later, and that we say unemployment is coming down when it isn't.<p>"We've got a real credibility problem and I can't see the end of it."<p>Leadership speculation increased when the former Premier, Human ServicesMinister Dean Brown, last night refused to rule out a challenge to MrOlsen, or to endorse Mr Olsen's leadership.<p>The Premier's office - like that of Dean Brown in the months before he wasdeposed - is poo-pooing the threat of any challenge.<p>Last weekend, a senior organisational member of the Liberal party told TheElectric Newspaper that Mr Olsen was rapidly running out of time to stamphis authority on the Party.<p>The official said Mr Olsen had to improve his image within the Partyorganisation.<p>"We've got to prepare for a Federal election. We can't have this(leadership issue) hanging around like a bad smell. It's going to be atough enough election, and we can't afford to be distracted," he said.<p>Meanwhile, the Government is facing a detailed examination of its Budgetwhen Parliament's Estimates Committees begin their hearings today.<p>Premier John Olsen will face his interlocutors at 11 o'clock this morning,and he can expect one or two questions on ETSA and Optima. <p>Estimates Committees look only at finances. Questions of leadership are outof order.<br clear=all><p><center><img src="http://www.electric.on.net/ads/ads_news/agriffiths_optometrist.gif" width=380 height=60 border=0></center><p><CENTER><hr noshade><A HREF="http://www.electric.on.net"        onMouseOver="waxon('home');        statuson('home'); return true;"        onMouseOut="statusoff(); waxoff('home');        return true;"><IMG name=home SRC="../buttons/butt_home_off.gif" ALT="home" WIDTH="140" HEIGHT="32" BORDER="0"></a><A HREF="../news/index.html"        onMouseOver="waxon('news');        statuson('news'); return true;"        onMouseOut="statusoff(); waxoff('news');        return true;"><IMG name=news SRC="../buttons/butt_news_off.gif" ALT="news" WIDTH="140" HEIGHT="32" BORDER="0"></a><hr noshade></CENTER><p><A HREF="http://www.electric.on.net">http://www.electric.on.net</A><p>&copy; This work is subject to copyright.
