The results of our survey.</font></B><br><FONT SIZE="-1">by Hendrik Gout</FONT><p>In late 1997, it was suggested that there was room in South Australia foranother daily newspaper. We didn't have the resources to print such anewspaper, but we did know there was a market. Thus The Electric Newspaperwas born. We've had as many as 171,000 hits a week, but generally ourreadership is now in the order of 40,000 - 45,000 a week. That's muchbigger than we anticipated in our most optimistic forecasts, and it makesThe Electric Newspaper one of the largest-circulation newspapers in SouthAustralia, second only to Mr Murdoch.<p>On The Team page you'll see who we are. All of us are professionalnewspaper or television journalists and producers, website developers, andvisual artists. <p>We're a long way from making The Electric Newspaper profitable. As you see,we're accepting commercial advertising, but the costs of running the paperare substantial (our last phone bill was $1,350). The only thing between usand debtor's prison at the moment is the voluntary donations you've sentin. One reader sent $200, which bought us food for a month. <p>We'd certainly like to encourage you to send in subscriptions. If you getthe Advertiser delivered you're paying News Corp about $7 a week. We couldcertainly improve our service if our readers paid us that. It would make abig difference to us. <p>After seven months of running a daily newspaper, we're still keen toimprove. That's why we asked you to fill out the reader survey - to findout from you what you like or dislike about The Electric Newspaper, and forus to find out whether we liked you!<p>Well, firstly, a big thank you to the many readers who took the time tocomplete the survey.<p>Who are you? Well, you're a bit like us, as it turns out. (There's moreabout our readers below.) And what you've said you want from The ElectricNewspaper is exactly what we're either trying to provide, or trying toprovide better.<p>Here's a summary of what you've told us, in no particular order. <p>Gripes<p><ol><li>  The frontpage takes too long to download, as do some of the sections.	We're trying different ways of making it faster. Ultimately this comesdown to having less information in each section, so that you can choosemore easily which areas you open. So we're trying for example to make thepictures smaller, so that you can click on an image to bring it upfull-size if you want to.<li> There's no coverage of AFL or SANFL.	Yes, and we're aware of the omission. We have contributors who are writingabout motorsport and, of course, Phil Owens does a sterling job with hisleague coverage, but we want more netball, basketball, and football. Wewelcome your suggestions as to who might be able to write about thesesports. Drop us an e-mail. Meanwhile, we're asking around.<li> There are not enough photos.	Agreed! We now have a second photographer, and we hope to include morenews and feature photos. At the moment, we're shooting a mixture of digitaland 35mm. It's been a very expensive and time-consuming process, but we'rehoping to get our hands on a new digital camera with more versatile optics. <li> There's not enough business news and analysis.	True too. We'll have to try to find a journalist with expertise in thisarea. It's definitely an area in which we haven't put enough resources.<li> You want occasional guest writers for the Viewpoints section, presentinga wider range of opinions.	Good. We'll deliver.<li> You want more cartoons. 	Well, George Aldridge has returned from his voyages, which made Jason andthe Argonauts seem like a weekend cruise. We hope to have more of hisfantastic work now that he's back.<li> You'd like to be able to search The Electric Newspaper for all thestories about, for example, electricity.	Yes, we need a search engine. We also need to get up and running our veryexpensive VCE, the new web engine developed in Adelaide, which will makeyour newspaper easier to navigate, faster for us to operate, and which hasten thousand other advantages. To do this, however, we need more hardware -specifically, a new Mac to sit at our provider and run the site. Weestimate the Mac will cost $5,000. It's beyond our resources at the moment.If you have a spare Mac sitting around, let us know...<li> You'd like related internet sites listed when they relate to aparticular news story.	Good idea. We'll do our best.</ol><p>There was a lot of praise for the paper, of course. Most readers like ourstyle, our sense of proportion, and the fact that we're not pompous orhectoring. People like our balance (but not always), our arts coverage (butsay there's not enough), and our film reviews. You want more travelstories, and a diary of upcoming South Australian events. You want agardening feature, you think we're not tough enough on Government (althoughnot everyone thinks so), and you generally feel as though it's yournewspaper as much as our own.<p>In that, we agree.<p>And what sort of people read The Electric Newspaper? A general overview ofour readers is as follows:<ul><li> university educated to bachelor's degree or higher<li> publicly employed - teachers, academics, scientists, policy-types insenior and middle-management<li> averaging $40k pa salary or higher<li> vote for a mix of the Parties <li> access the site from work<li> read the site 3 times a week<li> live in Adelaide, but a number live overseas and interstate.</ul><p>We have three peak hit times - about 9.30 a.m., about 12.30 p.m., and about6.30 p.m. <p>Finally, what does all this mean for us? Well, we've got a lot of work todo before we can get even vaguely boastful, but we're so far very pleasedwith the number of readers and the response. Still, it's true that ourlimit is now reached on present finances. Our address, in case we're beingtoo coy, is 108 L'Estrange Street, Glenunga, SA. 5064. We take cash,cheques, or single malt. (Please make cheques out to The Electric Newspaper.) <p>For many of us on The Team, we've never worked so hard or such long hours.It has nevertheless been a lot of fun. Now we hope to make it better. We'dlike to thank you for reading us. You, too, are part of the team.<p><B>Hendrik Gout</B><br>Editor and publisher<br clear=all><p><CENTER><hr noshade><A HREF="http://www.electric.on.net"        onMouseOver="waxon('home');        statuson('home'); return true;"        onMouseOut="statusoff(); waxoff('home');        return true;"><IMG name=home SRC="../buttons/butt_home_off.gif" ALT="home" WIDTH="140" HEIGHT="32" BORDER="0"></a><A HREF="../news/index.html"        onMouseOver="waxon('news');        statuson('news'); return true;"        onMouseOut="statusoff(); waxoff('news');        return true;"><IMG name=news SRC="../buttons/butt_news_off.gif" ALT="news" WIDTH="140" HEIGHT="32" BORDER="0"></a><hr noshade></CENTER><p><A HREF="http://www.electric.on.net">http://www.electric.on.net</A><p>&copy; This work is subject to copyright.
