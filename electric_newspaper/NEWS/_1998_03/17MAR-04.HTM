since we started using computers (and in apractical sense that was during World War II) we've wondered howintelligent they can become and if they can ever really be like humans.<p>	Associate Professor Powers' own work has focused on equipping computers towork out the structure of a given language and then the meaning of what itis saying by looking at the context in which things occur.<p>	In this he is utilising aspects of phonology (the technique for analysinglanguages) and cryptography (code breaking) and even following in thefootsteps of Sherlock Holmes who, in one famous case, cracked a code bylooking at the frequency with which the letters appeared.	<p>	Associate Professor Powers' program can identify the structure of anarbitrary text in an arbitrary language by examining its characters or eventhe speech frequencies. <p>	It locates the significant units of the language then works out from thereby applying the same technique over and over again to the surroundingcontacts, building up bigger and bigger chunks, like syllables, words andphrases.<p>	The system is now basically a very sophisticated word and grammar checkerbut it still exists solely within a computer. The next stage is to connectit in the real world, and Associate Professor Powers is working withAdelaide-based company I2Net to build a natural language front-end whichcan control appliances.<p>	"By connecting the program to a robot which interacts with the localenvironment we can move from simply understanding syntax and grammar tounderstanding the world," he said. <p>	"That's what's needed to pass the Turing Test".<p>	The Turing Test was developed by British mathematician Alan Turing, one ofthe pioneers of computing, and is the basis for the Loebner Prize.<p>	The competition was established by American inventor, businessman andphilanthropist Dr Hugh Loebner and previously was held at the BostonComputer Museum in the US.<p>	It was held at Sydney's PowerHouse Museum this year but will move toAdelaide next year.<p><hr noshade><p><A HREF="http://www.electric.on.net">http://www.electric.on.net</A><p>&copy; This work is subject to copyright.
