You might also not read in in his tabloids, oreven in the far-flung reaches of the Murdoch empire, including the AdelaideAdvertiser.<p>	It's about the extraordinary power of Rupert Murdoch to censor what you read.<p>	Yesterday, a second prominent English author revealed that HarperCollins,the book publishing company owned by  Mr Murdoch, was demanding changes toa manuscript because the book threatened News Limited interests in Asia.<p>	This follows the move last week by Harper Collins from publishing a bookby the former Governor of Hong Kong, Christopher Patton, which criticisedthe Chinese Government.<p>	In the latest row, the publisher wanted to force changes to a book aboutAmnesty International, dealing with human rights abuses in China.<p>	Separately, Chris Patten is set to extend his legal action againstHarperCollins to include Mr Murdoch, bringing the prospect of the two mengoing head to head in court. <p>                 Mr Patten's solicitor has written to HarperCollins askingabout Mr Murdoch's outspoken attack on HarperCollins and his assertion thatthe publisher "invented reasons" why it did not want to publish the book.     <p>	David Hooper, who acts for Mr Patten, said yesterday that if he did notget a satisfactory response to his questions a writ would be served on MrMurdoch today or on Monday, alleging Mr Murdoch interfered unduly in thecontractbetween HarperCollins and Mr Patten. <p>	The strongly worded letter again ups the stakes the battle between the twomen, which is becoming one of the most astonishing sagas the publishingworld has seen. <p>                 Mr Patten's book, East and West, was scrapped byHarperCollins after Mr Murdoch expressed dissatisfaction that thepublishers had signed the original £125,000 contract. <p>	The book will contain passages critical of China. Yesterday it was       reported that Mr Murdoch was close to a "mega-deal" in the region toset up television services which will eventually bring in vast profits. <p>	The fresh legal action will rest on Mr Murdoch's public statements in aninterview on Tuesday to Ray Snoddy, the media editor of the Times, which isowned by Mr Murdoch. He said: "I did not tell people to try and censor thebook or invent excuses not to do it. <p>                 "I said: why don't you go and say we would rather havesomeone else publish this and if there is any chance of losing money wewill make good. <p>                 "They chickened out and they got themselves into theposition where they were inventing reasons in the middle of January whythey just didn't want to publish it which were nonsense, leaving me in acompletely inexcusable position." <p>                 Mr Patten sees Mr Murdoch's words as evidence thatHarperCollins manufactured reasons to drop his book. <p>	Mr Murdoch said that senior exectuives had "screwed up" over the deal. <p>                The reasons for his sensitivities became clearer last nightwhen informed sources said Mr Murdoch  was on the brink of a "mega-deal" toextend his media interests in China. <p>                 Star TV, the satellite channel owned by Mr Murdoch thatbroadcasts into China, was reported to have hammered out a joint venturewith Chinese interests to sell advertising and collect subscriptions for aChinese channel. <p>                 If confirmed, the deal would be a significant boost to MrMurdoch.<p>                 Earlier this year it was announced that Phoenix, asubsidiary of Star, would be allowed to supply cable television services tosouthern China. Both will be lucrative deals, turning Star's losses of £30million a year into large future profits. <p>	As you may have read in the Advertiser...	<p><hr noshade><p><A HREF="http://www.electric.on.net">http://www.electric.on.net</A><p>&copy; This work is subject to copyright.
