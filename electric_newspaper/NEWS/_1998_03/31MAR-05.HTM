Generators startedturning for the first time as Reece's new hydro scheme completed thedestruction of Lake Pedder.<p>	Today, Tasmania is broke, its living standard the lowest in the country,and three out off every ten able-bodied people are out of work. Tasmania'sinfatuation with hydro power as an economic miracle is all too obviouslyover. The Gordon power station is a legacy to monumental governmentstupidity and cowardice.<p>	Here in South Australia, another Government is tottering into a muchsmaller but equally nonsensical development - the West Beach boat harbour.If this scheme goes ahead - and it will - South Australians are going tohave to pay half a million dollars a year, from now until the sun growscold, to pay for a sand replenishment program.<p>	That's a lot of schools, a lot of hospitals, a lot of buses and better roads.<p>	The harbour at West Beach is being built because the State Government hashanded to private developers a public boat ramp at Glenelg. There, thedevelopers are building a marina so the boat ramp - used by average,middle-class families - is being subsumed to make way for expensiveapartments and private yacht moorings.<p>	Not everyone is wildly enthusiastic about this idea.<p>	The Government is building a new public boat ramp and harbour at WestBeach, a few kilometres north of Glenelg. The ramp will require a massivegroyne, which will stop the natural northward drift of sand in the Gulf St.Vincent. It's to save the beaches further north that sand will have to betrucked around the groyne in perpetuity. If the replenishment program isever stopped, the northern beaches will become low, rocky cliffs.<p>	Which is why beachside residents are protesting. In a so-far unsuccessfulcampaign, they've formed a committee, formed a blockade, formed a communityaction group. <p>	They have not stopped progress, but they've highlighted the absurdity ofthe boat harbour proposal. And they've embarrassed the Government.<p>	Today, the Government had had enough.<p>	Not long after 10 o'clock today, a cool-headed and not unfriendly chiefinspector of the Government's crime-fighting force, the SA police, told theprotesters blocking access to the construction site that they had 20minutes to remove themselves.<p>	"Under what authority?" asked an elderly woman.<p>	And chief inspector Brenton Mart then read out long list of specialregulations gazetted minutes earlier. No protesters, no media, no nothin'except construction workers could go past a line drawn in the West Beachsand. Even the Gulf is closed to ships, swimmers, and sailboards in theWest Beach area.<p>	The elderly woman was led away, shaking her head.<p>	Twenty-seven minutes later, MacNamara Fencing Contractors had erected atwo metre-tall fence across what was, until this morning, a public road. <p>	"There are alternatives to the harbour design ," said spokesperson BridgetBannear. "This doesn't have to be built this way. All we're asking is thatthe Government seriously consider the options."<p>	Maybe, but at least 48 police, some mounted, some on motorbikes, some inpaddy wagons, and some who clearly didn't want to be there, are helping theGovernment enforce democracy and make sure that built it will be built.<p>	The Liberal member for the area, Steve Condous, had during the electioncampaign promised to lie down in front of the bulldozers. Today, hecouldn't look a police Grey in the face. The honourable member was no-whereto be seen.<p>	Neither was the Opposition. Labor supported the building of the groyne, 	 needlessly capitulating to fears that it would have been painted as"anti-development" had the legislation not passed.<p>	When the Gordon power station was commissioned, there was no shortage ofdignitaries ready to take part in the opening ceremony. Most of them aredead now. The rest are merely forgotten.<p>	At least a groyne will be easier to dismantle than a power station.<p><br clear=all><CENTER><hr noshade><A HREF="http://www.electric.on.net"        onMouseOver="waxon('home');        statuson('home'); return true;"        onMouseOut="statusoff(); waxoff('home');        return true;"><IMG name=home SRC="../buttons/butt_home_off.gif" ALT="home" WIDTH="140" HEIGHT="32" BORDER="0"></a><A HREF="../news/index.html"        onMouseOver="waxon('news');        statuson('news'); return true;"        onMouseOut="statusoff(); waxoff('news');        return true;"><IMG name=news SRC="../buttons/butt_news_off.gif" ALT="news" WIDTH="140" HEIGHT="32" BORDER="0"></a><hr noshade></CENTER><p><A HREF="http://www.electric.on.net">http://www.electric.on.net</A><p>&copy; This work is subject to copyright.
