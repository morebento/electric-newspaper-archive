Inflation is currently running atminus 1.1 per cent in SA..<p>Faced with huge wage increases for public sector employees, State Treasurywas directed by the Premier and Treasurer to find a way of coming up withmore cash.<p>The Government has not come up with a creative solution - it will justscrap the promise.<p>The Government has, in effect, arbitarily set the CPI increase at 4.5 percent, and will increase a range of fees such as fines, car registration,and possibly public transport ticket prices, by approximately that muchfrom June 1.<p>The Opposition opposed. The Democrats quietly applauded.<p>"State Government fees and charges are set to run well ahead of inflationas South Australians pay for John Olsen's handling of the economy," ShadowTreasurer Kevin Foley said.<p>"Following the ETSA broken promise and the shopping hours announcement, wehave the fees and charges backflip.<p>"Taxpayers should mark this day down as 'Tax Wednesday'," Mr Foley said.<p>The Democrats supported the Budget considerations.<p>"The Australian Democrats have consistently said that we would rather seetaxes and fees increased than a continual cut to areas such as health,education, and other essential services," said Democrats leader Mike Elliott.<p>But the Democrats said they had two reservations: the Government's refusalto allow proper scrutiny of multi-million outsourcing contracts byParliamentary committees, and the high levels of secret subsidies theGovernment is providing to certain favoured projects.<p>The signs of looming pressure on the Budget were apparent to Treasury formore than six months. Under-Treasurer Gerard Bradley was so concerned itlast year briefed the then Treasurer, Stephen Baker. <p>Unfortunately, this came about the same time as the State election, whichmeans the news was with-held from voters.<p>During the election campaign, on September 22, Mr Olsen said that despitethe pressure, the Government would deliver a planned $1 million surplus in1997-98 and further surpluses of up to $6 million during a further threeyears.<p>Treasury officials said last night they had recoiled when Mr Olsen'scampaign comments were reported the next day. They knew it was impossible.<p>Yesterday's decision is likely to raise about an extra $20 million in oneyear alone. <p>Also yesterday came the news that the Premier had agreed to pay a campaignadvisor $10,000 a month.<p>She was Ms Alex Kennedy, a former speechwriter and media secretary to MrOlsen.<p>Ms Kennedy's fee nevertheless seemed paltry compared with the free-spendingcredit card holders on the Government team.<p>Mr Olsen's current press secretary rang up a few hundred dollars shy of$10,000 on her Government credit card since the start of 1997.<p>The information came as a response to a question in Parliament from Laborfront-bencher Ralph Clarke. <p>"The Premier is an extremely generous employer," Mr Clarke said outside theHouse.<p><hr noshade><p><A HREF="http://www.electric.on.net">http://www.electric.on.net</A><p>&copy; This work is subject to copyright.
