He would be bipartisan in his approach on major issues.  Since theelection he has continued to huff and puff about bipartisanship.  It's justa pity he doesn't practise it.  <p>Premier John Olsen flew out late Wednesday afternoon, July 1 for talks inMelbourne with Premier Jeff Kennett on taxation reform and later as numberone ticketholder for the Adelaide 36'ers he supported the team in its bidfor the national basketball premiership - its first since 1986.  However,Leader of the Opposition, Mike Rann, had refused to give John Olsen a pairfor this trip to Melbourne.  As the Premier quite rightly observed in theHouse of Assembly, it was "petty, small-minded".  <p>In Parliament there are some genuine friendships between Members onopposite sides.  If a Member has relatives who are seriously ill, a pair isreadily granted.  There is also a respect for the conventions of the House. Protocol demands that the Premier of the day should be entitled to absenthimself for events or activities which are deemed to be of interest andimportance to the State.  Premier John Bannon was never denied aParliamentary pair to attend an important sporting event such as the GrandPrix.  <p>Mike Rann does not have a pretty record when it comes to making the rightdecisions on big issues.  He was violent in his opposition to Roxby Downsand encouraged people to boycott BP petrol stations as at that time BP wasa joint owner of the project.  Today Roxby Downs is one of the State'sgreat success stories of this century, boasting 4,000 people.  Ironically,the 1996 ALP platform, in discussing development in country areas of SouthAustralia, notes "other centres, in particular, Roxby Downs, are enjoyingmajor expansion".  Mike Rann was wrong on Roxby Downs- dead wrong.  <p>In the last few days we have witnessed Mike Rann's legendary bipartisanshipon the big issues.  The privatisation of ETSA and Optima is currently beingdebated in the Parliament.  In October 1996 the Labor Party Convention inSouth Australia revised its State platform.  Page 60 of that platformunambiguously notes "Labor is committed to maintain ETSA's generation,transmission and distribution assets in public ownership."  In other words,Rann is handcuffed to a policy of opposing ETSA privatisation because of adecision made nearly two years ago.  <p>Just pause a moment and think about how the real world works.  Can youthink of a business or an organisation that would not review a decisionmade two years ago in the face of dramatically changing circumstances inits industry?  I certainly can't.  And yet that is what the Rann-led LaborParty is resolutely doing.  <p>This is in sharp contrast to the Labor Government in New South Wales, whereTreasurer Michael Egan is actively campaigning to change Labor Party policyto allow the Government to privatise the power industry and raise anestimated $22 billion which would slash the State's debt to zero.  <p>In a paper distributed to the power and electricity unions last year, Eganmade the following comments:<p>"The provision of electricity is not redundant;  however in my view itsprovision by government is.  When large-scale electricity generation wasfirst established in the late nineteenth century, capital markets wereprimitive.  Government had to do the job themselves or give monopolies toprivate companies to generate power. <p>"This is no longer the case.  As demonstrated the world over, a competitiveprivate sector can now produce and distribute electricity effectively."<p>Egan claimed "there is no sustainable argument that the government, thetaxpayers, the environment, consumers and the economy would be worse off ifwe had more than one owner of the major electricity utilities in New SouthWales."<p>In an excellent summary of the arguments for privatisation of power Egannoted "in the long term our electricity businesses will be facing onlyincreasing commercial and competitive pressures.  In the short to mediumterm, the sale of the businesses will provide additional budget flexibilityfor the government as well as potentially funding a number of major capitalprojects."<p>Rann, whose ostrich-like attitude to Roxby Downs was matched only by hisnaivety and indifference to persistent Liberal questioning over the StateBank, should take particular note of Egan's observation that "it is naiveto think that the great economic and social changes over the last fewdecades will soon cease ...Governments need to reap the benefits of thesechanges while softening the impacts of change and protecting the essentialvalues of the community ...New South Wales either had to gear up for thesechanges or risk losing a competitive edge against other States or othercountries."<p>Egan made the point that "no longer is electricity a monopoly business withguaranteed returns to government.  It is an increasingly commercial andcompetitive business with increasing risk to its profits.  The choice forgovernment is whether it regulates and oversees this industry to securegood social and economic outcomes, or whether it owns the industry, therebyrisking millions of dollars of taxpayers' money in commercial businessenterprises, rather than investing those funds in social and economicservices and facilities that are the core areas of government responsibility."<p>Egan concluded by noting that "the social and economic benefits of sellingour electricity utilities, I believe, are very clear.  It is now up to theopponents of sale to join the debate by identifying any specific social andeconomic advantage which they might argue can only be gained by retention."<p>Well Mike, I couldn't have put it better myself.  How do you argue againstthat logic?  I would like to hear why the power industry in South Australiais different from that in New South Wales.  <p>With Rann's track record on Roxby Downs and the State Bank, you would thinkthat he might be a bit more careful the third time around.  But no, MikeRann last week refused to attend a government briefing on ETSA offered toall Labor Members by Premier John Olsen.  How extraordinary!  Here was anopportunity to have a briefing from international experts and Treasuryofficers on the biggest issue facing the State since Mike Rann refused toface the questions on the State Bank nearly a decade ago, and what does hedo?  He refuses again.  Rann said he would only attend the briefing ifPremier John Olsen agreed to a television debate on the issue and alsoprovided various reports on the privatisation.  <p>However, former ALP State Secretary, Terry Cameron, who is arguably theonly member of the Labor Caucus with any real business background, acceptedthe invitation and issued a challenge to Mr Rann "to direct me not to go".  <p>And so it came to pass that just a few days later 15 Members of the LaborCaucus were at the lunchtime briefing on Wednesday July 8.  What on earthhappened?  Did Mike Rann receive a blinding flash from a stobie pole?  No.It was simply that some Labor Members genuinely wanted to attend thebriefing.  Mike, who had his finger in the dyke, suddenly found he couldn'tprevent the flood of responses and so he followed his followers to thebriefing.  How farcical!<p>Aren't the voters of South Australia entitled to expect the Oppositionshould take such an important matter seriously?  Particularly when MikeRann silently acquiesced to the privatisation of QANTAS, the CommonwealthBank and the Commonwealth Serum Laboratories (CSL) by the Federal LaborGovernment, which also had in principle supported a partial sale ofTelstra.  Rann, as a member of the Bannon government, put his hand up forthe privatisation of the State Bank of South Australia and the sale of thegovernment's controlling interest in Sagasco.<p>Mike, I've looked at the sky and QANTAS hasn't fallen out of it.  I've justrung Information and confirmed that Telstra's still around.  And how manycomplaints have you heard from Mike Rann about the supply of gas toconsumers in South Australia since he was a party to privatising it a fewyears ago?  <p>It's all a bit sad.  We live in a State where people get excited aboutopposing things while the rest of the world sweeps by.  Rann, whosefinancial and business acumen would not bother the scorer on his efforts onRoxby Downs and the State Bank, is doing South Australia a disservice byrefusing to convene a special Labor convention to revisit the issue of ETSAprivatisation.  If New South Wales Labor Premier, Bob Carr, and hisTreasurer, Michael Egan, want to do it, and Premier Jeff Kennett inVictoria has already done it, and the whisper is that newly elected LaborPremier, Peter Beattie in Queensland also wants to do it, why can't MikeRann do it?  <br clear=all><p><center><img src="http://www.electric.on.net/ads/ads_news/agriffiths_optometrist.gif" width=380 height=60 border=0></center><p><center><hr noshade><A HREF="http://www.electric.on.net"        onMouseOver="waxon('home');        statuson('home'); return true;"        onMouseOut="statusoff(); waxoff('home');        return true;"><IMG name=home SRC="../buttons/butt_home_off.gif" ALT="home" WIDTH="140" HEIGHT="32" BORDER="0"></a><A HREF="../essays/index.html"        onMouseOver="waxon('essays');        statuson('essays'); return true;"        onMouseOut="statusoff(); waxoff('essays');        return true;"><IMG name=essays SRC="../buttons/butt_essays_off.gif" ALT="essays" WIDTH="140" HEIGHT="32" BORDER="0"></a><hr noshade></center><p><A HREF="http://www.electric.on.net">http://www.electric.on.net</A><p>&copy; This work is subject to copyright.
