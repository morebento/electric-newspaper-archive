This handwritten note said, "Can't anyone explain to theQueensland population what damage the Hanson credo is doing to Australiaand its reputation overseas?"  <p>The fax was accompanied by a column from the highly respected magazine, TheEconomist, published just before the Queensland election on June 13.  TheEconomist observed that Hanson's "campaign language draws heavily on abrand of right wing populism imported from America.  She promises toabolish gun controls and to set up a rural bank to make loans to farmers atjust 2% interest.  She would pay for her promises by scrapping spending onvarious causes promoted by urban Australians, such as the arts, aborigines..."<p>The Economist also noted that Mrs Hanson's popularity has "tarnishedAustralia's image in Asia, where the former fish and chip shop proprietoris seen as representing the discredited ‘White Australia' policy.Queensland has been Australia's fastest growing State and receives muchAsian investment in property and tourism."<p>Perceptions can be quickly created but take much longer to erase.  It is abit like an intricate stained glass window made up of many different piecesof glass and painstakingly crafted.  But one stone from an errant child cansmash many hours of labour.  <p>As the twentieth century draws to a close, it can be fairly said that oneof the nation's great achievements has been the bipartisan migrationprogramme which has seen 5.6 million migrants settle in Australia since1945.  Nearly one in four  Australians were born overseas and at leastanother one in five have one or more parents born overseas.  In otherwords, around 43% (or 8 million) of the country's population of 18.6million was either born overseas or have one or more parents born overseas. People from well over 100 countries now call Australia home.  Succeedingwaves of migrants from the United Kingdom, Italy, Greece, Germany, Hollandand the Baltic States dominated our intake until the late 1970's.  Sincethen New Zealanders, Asians, South Americans and South Africans haveaccounted for the bulk of our migrants.<p>In the 1990's our annual migration intake has averaged around 60,000 to65,000, or only 0.35% of total population.  This is in sharp contrast to1950, when net migration to Australia was 152,500.  This represented 1.8%of Australia's population in 1950 which was around 8.4 million.  If we tookthe rate of intake in 1950 and had the same rate of intake in proportion tothe population, our immigration would be now running at around 330,000 ayear.  <p>Pauline Hanson is ignorant and ill-informed.  In 1996 she made headlines byclaiming that Asians would account for 30% of the population by the year2000 and 50% by the year 2040.  However, the 1996 census reveals thatpeople born in Asia represent 4.8% of the population.  The Hanson figurewas just pure fiction!  <p>Notwithstanding the benefits of migration to Australia over the last 50years, One Nation has a goal of slashing net migration to zero.  This ispopulist nonsense.  <p>In the last few days I have perused the policies of Pauline Hanson's OneNation party for the Queensland State election, as they appear on theInternet.  <p>One Nation appeared to go to the polls with no coherent policies intransport and health and many other key areas.  Its education policy ofjust a few paragraphs had as much substance as a mirage in the desert.Although this policy trumpeted that “all young Australians .... should..... be taught Australian history, the meaning and purpose of ourConstitution, our system of government, patriotism and loyalty to ourcountry”, elsewhere One Nation stated it would save $0.56 million byabolishing the Queensland Centenary of Federation Committee whichpresumably would be planning to direct a significant sum of money tohistory projects.  <p>Its economics was straight from the funny farm.  To quote the policy,"Pauline Hanson's One Nation stands by the principle of developing apeople's bank and .... will create the Queensland Trust."  This Trust "isintended to assist farmers with a financial capacity for survival.  On acase by case basis, funds will be made available at a flat fixed interestrate of 2%.  ....New industry/manufacturing ventures will be provided withfunds on a loan basis also at .... 2%.  Monies will be available on adollar for dollar basis for new ventures in city areas and a $2 for $1basis for new ventures in rural areas.  Funds will be made available toexisting small businesses for the purposes of expansion .... at a flatfixed interest rate of 2%."<p>Let me at it!  Where does the queue start?  At the funny farm of courseand, as we have heard in the last few days, One Nation was going to printmoney to turn this policy into reality!  <p>But wait - One Nation leaves the man from Demtel in the shade.  There ismuch, much more.<p>One Nation proposes in its Law and Order, Crime and Punishment policy,"that in order to make the judiciary accountable, at each State election,the public of Queensland, the ordinary citizens, will have the opportunityto elect 12 of its peers who will form the membership of a State JudiciaryReview Board. ....which .... will conduct annual reviews of the judiciaryand make recommendations with regard to, or termination of, the appointmentof those who fail to uphold the sentencing policies of the State governmentof the day."  Wow!  This is better than the Wild West!<p>You need to be sitting down for the next one.  Let me again quote directly. "One Nation will give police the discretionary power to remove peopleunder the age of 16 years from the streets and return them to their home orto a suitable venue".  This is a superficially popular policy which isinherently dangerous.<p>In addition, "One Nation will allow parents to administer just and fairdomestic discipline within their homes, without fear or favour ofinterference from external agencies, thus restoring the authority of thefamily".  And perhaps also adding to the queues in Casualty at Queenslandhospitals!  <p>Finally, One Nation trots out the old chestnut, "Queensland's crime rate isincreasing exponentially" - that is very rapidly.  Again, this is a hoarymyth.  Contact with the Queensland Attorney-General's Department revealsthat there was in fact a reduction in homicide convictions over the lastthree years and that after taking into account population increases, therewas arguably a reduction in major crimes on a per capita basis over thatperiod.<p>Many of the above extraordinary policies have never been headlined orscrutinised by the media.  The same media is quite often obsessed withhighlighting negative trivia about the major players on the politicalstage.  It's just a shame they didn't subject Hanson's inadequate policiesto the same scrutiny.  <br clear=all><p><center><img src="http://www.electric.on.net/ads/ads_news/agriffiths_optometrist.gif" width=380 height=60 border=0></center><p><center><hr noshade><A HREF="http://www.electric.on.net"        onMouseOver="waxon('home');        statuson('home'); return true;"        onMouseOut="statusoff(); waxoff('home');        return true;"><IMG name=home SRC="../buttons/butt_home_off.gif" ALT="home" WIDTH="140" HEIGHT="32" BORDER="0"></a><A HREF="../essays/index.html"        onMouseOver="waxon('essays');        statuson('essays'); return true;"        onMouseOut="statusoff(); waxoff('essays');        return true;"><IMG name=essays SRC="../buttons/butt_essays_off.gif" ALT="essays" WIDTH="140" HEIGHT="32" BORDER="0"></a><hr noshade></center><p><A HREF="http://www.electric.on.net">http://www.electric.on.net</A><p>&copy; This work is subject to copyright.
