The notice convening the meeting was headed'Independents' and stated that the purpose of the meeting was "to discussthe formation of a working relationship between 10 State Labor MP's (whocollectively represent the Non-Aligned, Independents, and the so-calledDuncan Left)".<p>This notice did not mince words.  It stated "the action was taken tobalance the aggressive behaviour of the Machine.  (A grouping of the BolkusLeft and the Right).  Over the last several months the Machine has made itclear that if any State MP is not a member of the Machine, they have adoubtful future in the parliamentary party."<p>Although the autumnal temperatures in Adelaide are falling, that'scertainly not happening in the Labor Party in South Australia.  <p>The notice bluntly concluded, "If the arrogant behaviour of the Machinewithin the party is to be checked, action such as that taken by the 10State MP's was essential.  The Machine's arrogance has reached the stagethat their power brokers have told many party members who would like toseek preselection for winnable seats that they have no future unless theyjoin the Machine."  <p>This notice was signed "Ralph Clarke, Convenor".  Yes - the same RalphClarke who until recently was the Deputy Leader of the Labor Party in SouthAustralia.<p>Now Ralph has had a pretty tough time over recent months.  He has a welldeserved reputation as a knockabout fighter in the parliamentary arena.Ralph has been thrown out of the House of Assembly six times in his career- more than any other person in recent years.  He is the quintessentialdeputy leader who can handle the rough stuff and dish it out and be abackup for the parliamentary leader.  <p>Of course the Machine saw otherwise and following the State election inOctober 1997, the blood was knee deep in the Labor Caucus room.  Poor Ralphwas from the centre of the party (some call it the lost centre).  He waschallenged for the Deputy Leadership by Machine candidate Annette Hurleyfrom the right of the party.  And in a bitter battle Hurley rolled Clarke.  <p>Where was Mike Rann in the days leading up to the contest?  Well he was outbushwalking.  The sort of thing you would expect from a leader who isanxious to ensure the best candidate for the job is elected.  <p>As the new Deputy Leader, Annette Hurley has refocussed attention on thelong-lost art of the ventriloquist's dummy.  The most polite description ofher performance has been benign.  And in a newspaper which is surelyscanned by thousands of young eyes, I cannot mention the colourfuladjectives attached to equally descriptive nouns used to describe Hurley.Her questioning is lacklustre and never spontaneous and she is mute in theheavy exchanges that inevitably accompany question time.<p>But the Machine rules OK?  All is not forgiven Ralph, even though theMachine knows deep in its heart (is that a contradiction?) you were thebest choice for Deputy Leader.  <p>Now Ralph has to skulk around organising meetings for the Independents whoare still very much in the minority.<p>As Ralph himself confirmed in the notice calling the meeting ofIndependents, the Machine has threatened the preselection of party memberswho do not belong to the Machine.  Sources in the Labor Party claim atleast 7 Members of Parliament have been intimidated by Machine members andtold their preselections are at risk.<p>The Liberal Party has not been without its challenges in recent months.But put in perspective, the Labor Party's deep-seated factionalism andhatred dwarfs any difficulties on the Liberal side of politics.  <p><center><hr noshade><A HREF="http://www.electric.on.net"        onMouseOver="waxon('home');        statuson('home'); return true;"        onMouseOut="statusoff(); waxoff('home');        return true;"><IMG name=home SRC="../buttons/butt_home_off.gif" ALT="home" WIDTH="140" HEIGHT="32" BORDER="0"></a><A HREF="../essays/index.html"        onMouseOver="waxon('essays');        statuson('essays'); return true;"        onMouseOut="statusoff(); waxoff('essays');        return true;"><IMG name=essays SRC="../buttons/butt_essays_off.gif" ALT="essays" WIDTH="140" HEIGHT="32" BORDER="0"></a><hr noshade></center><p><A HREF="http://www.electric.on.net">http://www.electric.on.net</A><p>&copy; This work is subject to copyright.
