Exactly what theexpression of contrition was to be for, varied according to the spin put onit by each news service. A consensus of opinion seemed to focus on theexperiences of the so-called "stolen generations". <p>For many Australians, aboriginal and others, this day stirred deep emotion.For these people, the day had a clear meaning and purpose. For most,however, I suspect that the event was one in which they took littleinterest. For some, it was the cause of private indignation. For a few, notconcerned with observing the Australian convention of silence in preferenceto affront, it provoked critical public comment.<p>The well-intentioned involvement of primary school children in the eventsof the day was a sad low-point. The spectacle of young children, strugglingto read prepared statements of remorse, is evocative of unsavourytotalitarian regimes. It is not fair. Let's leave our children out of theloop until they are able to fully comprehend the issues and formulate theirown views.<p>Being sorry is not a simple business. Who should be sorry ? To whom, andfor what ?<p>Since the arrival of Europeans in Australia, (now described in some schooltexts as "invasion day"),the aboriginal way of life has been under siege.By the turn of the century, most dispossession of aborigines from theirland had already occurred. In Tasmania, aboriginal culture and languagewere essentially lost. In the south-east of the continent, a traditionallifestyle was destroyed by European influences, foods and diseases.Aborigines lived in conditions of squalor. They had little opportunity foreducation, employment or participation in our society.<p>Well-intentioned people saw these problems and sought to find solutions. Atthe time, assimilation into the cultural main-stream was viewed as the bestanswer. This same philosophy was applied in a different form to"new-Australians", escaping a war-torn Europe. We were all to become partof the core Australian culture. In doing so, all would be accepted.<p>State welfare agencies had the power to remove children from theirfamilies. This occurred when it was deemed to be in the interests of thechild. This policy was applied to all children, not just aborigines. Itstill is. In this context it should not be a surprise that AustralianParliaments permitted the removal of aboriginal children from theirmothers. In passing these laws, it was thought that these children wouldget a better chance in life. They would be educated. They would eventuallybe employed. They would not die in infancy from utterly preventable illness.<p>Foster parents came forward. No doubt, there are tragic horror stories ofabuse. These however, were not the rule. Most foster parents were ordinarymums and dads. They were inspired by the best of motives, to give a child agood home and a chance at a better life.<p>Of course today these policies are judged to be "genocidal". Values haveshifted. In these days of multi-culturalism, to have been "snatcheduntimely" from one's cultural roots, is a serious personal loss. Oursociety has taken to the celebration of difference as enthusiastically asit once demanded conformity. It is hardly surprising that many aborigines,taken from their mothers, should deeply feel a loss of belonging.<p>Our community values have evolved and will continue to evolve. In time,they may even come full circle.  "Sorry Day" has exposed the realdifficulty of obtaining a sincere apology from all Australians, for wellintentioned deeds of the past. In the end, surely we must be judged andjudge our ancestors, by the mores of the times. The nation needs a focus onthe here and now, not on the then and if.<p>We allow aborigines to live in abject squalor in 1998. We still tolerateaborigines dying younger than the rest of us. We still allow aborigines toswell the ranks of our unemployed and to fill our prisons. Most shameful ofall, our Governments refuse to accept the self-evident truths embodied inthe High Court's recognition of Native Title. These are the elements of aheartfelt national shame for which all decent Australians would gladlyexpress contrition.    <p><center><hr noshade><A HREF="http://www.electric.on.net"        onMouseOver="waxon('home');        statuson('home'); return true;"        onMouseOut="statusoff(); waxoff('home');        return true;"><IMG name=home SRC="../buttons/butt_home_off.gif" ALT="home" WIDTH="140" HEIGHT="32" BORDER="0"></a><A HREF="../essays/index.html"        onMouseOver="waxon('essays');        statuson('essays'); return true;"        onMouseOut="statusoff(); waxoff('essays');        return true;"><IMG name=essays SRC="../buttons/butt_essays_off.gif" ALT="essays" WIDTH="140" HEIGHT="32" BORDER="0"></a><hr noshade></center><p><A HREF="http://www.electric.on.net">http://www.electric.on.net</A><p>&copy; This work is subject to copyright.
