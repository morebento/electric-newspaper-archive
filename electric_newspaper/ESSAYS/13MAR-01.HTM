There are simply notenough jobs now,  and economic growth is too low to generate enough jobsfor those who want them.<p>	At the beginning of 1998 there were around 58 unemployed people forevery job vacancy advertised in South Australia. The number of jobvacancies is less than in the late 1980s. Vacancies remain around 45percent below the peak in January 1990.<p>	South Australia is the only mainland state to have made no inroad intounemployment over the twelve months to January 1998. Indeed the SouthAustralian unemployment rate has steadily increased over this periodrising to 9.9 percent (seasonally adjusted) in February 1998. While thenational unemployment rate eased down by 0.5 percent in January, the staterateincreased by 0.5 percent. This signals the collapse of jobs growth andan economy which is ailing.<p>	Over seven per cent of the South Australian labour force, or 52,000people,would prefer to be working more hours than they currently are. If addedto the 71,500 people currently unemployed (January 1998) the combinednumber of people seeking work or more work could increase thecompetition for available job vacancies by up to 75 percent.<p>	There were fewer  people employed in South Australia in January1998 thanthere were in January 1997. The foundation of secure jobs in SouthAustralia is being undermined by the loss of around 720 full-time jobsper month over the two years to December 1997. In addition to publicsector workforce reductions averaging more than 6,000 a year over thelast four years nearly 14,000 people per year were laid off orretrenched over the last four years. Over the 1994-98 period the annualaverage number of people laid off or retrenched has steadily increased.<p>	In 1991 around 18 percent of employed people in South Australia were instate public sector employment. Over the 1992-97 period the state publicsector share of total employment declined to 14 percent, representing a22 percent change in just four years. Combined, the large numbers ofpublic sector and private sector losses have directly contributed tohigher rates of long-term unemployment in South Australia.<p>	Perhaps one of the most disturbing features of the current crisisis thevery high level of long-term unemployment in South Australia (thosepeople unemployed for more that 12 months). Nearly 42 percent ofunemployed South Australians have been unemployed for twelve months ormore. This is by far the highest level in Australia, exceeding evenTasmania, which historically fares worse than South Australia in theunemployment stakes. At nearly 70 weeks the average duration ofunemployment in South Australia is only exceeded by Tasmania.<p>	South Australian employment growth should be rising with the tide ofnational economic recovery. Instead it is sinking. At this stage of theeconomic cycle, it is reasonable to expect that inroads would be madeinto unemployment. Indeed at the end of the 1980s recovery period SouthAustralia's unemployment rate had declined to around seven per cent.<p>	With each recession during the last ten years the unemployment rate hasratcheted upwards. If significant gains are not made during the currentrecovery period unemployment in South Australia is set to ratchet everupwards. Under these circumstances double digit unemployment is likelyto be the norm rather than the exception in South Australia. This socialand economic crisis is not inevitable. I believe it can be averted bygovernmentswhich have the courage and the wisdom to embrace and implement newideas.<p>	The performance of the South Australian economy over the past fouryears has been poor relative to other mainland states and the nation asa whole. Growth rates during the current recovery period have not beensufficient to bring down unemployment to levels experienced during thelate 1980s recovery period. Deteriorating economic growth rates over the1995-97 period have resulted in much lower employment growth than wasexpected. The outcome for Gross State Product (GSP) growth for the1996-97 period was nearly 50 percent less than the forecast rate of 2.25percent. In contrast national rates of growth in Gross Domestic Producthave risen over 1996-97 by 2.8 percent.<p>	The challenge for government at all levels is clear. Their performanceover the next two years will be measured against the extent to whichthey makes significant inroads into unemployment.<p><hr noshade><p><A HREF="http://www.electric.on.net">http://www.electric.on.net</A><p>&copy; This work is subject to copyright.
