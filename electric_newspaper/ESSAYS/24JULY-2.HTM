(Meres Orgis, A. Coutas )<p>The chilling scene described above is neither from Bosnia, Rwanda, Kuwaitnor Vietnam.  It is in fact July 20, 1974 on the Mediterraneanisland-republic of Cyprus.  It describes the invasion and subsequentoccupation and partition of the island by Turkey.  The island remainsdivided to this day and stands as the only forcible partitioned nation inEurope.  This is not the place nor am I in a position to present a completeand detailed examination of this on-going tragedy; rather I will focus onAustralia's involvement in the issue and whether it has a role in thesolution.<p>As readers of the News section of the Electric Newspaper would have noted,last weekend the Cypriot and Greek communities marked the 24th anniversaryof the invasion and occupation.  A memorial was conducted for those wholost their lives and to pray for a peaceful resolution to the ongoingissue.  The ceremony was attended by politicians from the Federal and StateGovernment and Opposition, and the new "not really a political partyperson" my colleague Nick Xenophon MLC, who is of part Cypriot heritage.Some of the more cynical readers might well say this is what politiciansusually do, because they are concerned with gaining sectional votes.  I canassure them that this is not the case.<p>The issue of Cyprus is one of justice and human rights.  It is one of theenduring tragedies of the last quarter of the twentieth century.  TheCyprus problem has been with us now for some 24 years.  Turkey, as theattacking and occupying force in Cyprus, has been condemned ininternational fora with many United Nations and European Union resolutions. Australia and Australians are also involved in many ways with Cyprus andas such, the Cyprus issue is a concern to this nation. <p>Australia has a long involvement in Cyprus.  It has had a peacekeepingpolice force (UNFICYP) on the island since 1964.  The Republic of Cyprus isalso a member of the Commonwealth of Nations, a fact I suspect is not thatwell known by many Australians.  Thousands of Cypriot people have migratedto Australia and become citizens, as part of post second World Warmigration.  Australia has also provided a home to many Cypriot refugeessince the 1974 invasion.  <p>Like many Australians, I remember being horrified at the so-called'peaceful intervention' in Cyprus by Turkish troops in 1974.  To place someof the chilling statistics in context, Cyprus has a population about halfof South Australia's, but is only 0.37% of its area.  The 'intervention'led to the 'ethnic cleansing' (well before it was a popular term) of over200,000 Greek Cypriots from their ancestral homes - some 40.5 percent ofthe Greek Cypriot population became refugees.  Turkey occupies 37 percentof the island, 6,000 Greek Cypriots lost their lives and over 1,600 personsremain missing.  Over 500 Orthodox churches and other sites of antiquitywere pillaged.  The 1974 value of the land and property lost by theinvasion is valued at $AUS 6.75 billion.<p>Since the invasion, Turkey has systematically manipulated the populationmix on the island by importing over 100,000 Turkish mainland colonists toCyprus.  Some 35,000-40,000 Turkish troops are stationed on the island,representing part of Europe's largest post Cold-War armed force.  Thetroops, together with the colonists, now make the Turkish Cypriots aminority in occupied north Cyprus.  About 50,000 Turkish Cypriots haveemigrated to other countries since 1974, casting doubt on the premise ofthe Turkish invasion, which was meant to protect and assist Turkish Cypriots.<p>To some, these may appear as just the usual statistics and figures ofevents that occurred some time ago and a long way away, but to thoseCypriots and Australians who have lost loved ones and homes, the pain andloss must be unbearable. <p>Unfortunately, it seems that despite the efforts of United Nationsdelegations, Turkey appears to be unmoved.  Instead of approaching asolution, the problem is being made harder to resolve.  An escalation oftension on the island recently, including the much publicised and horrificbashing and murders in the UN demilitarized zone and the Cypriot moves topurchase an S-300 ground-to-air defence system, is rapidly making Cyprus areal international 'hot-spot'. <p>The United States has a major role to play in any cessation of the illegalTurkish occupation, particularly as both Greece and Turkey are NATOmembers.  Some people fear that an increase in tension in Cyprus andcontinued violence may cause further tragedy between two historiccombatants in the Aegean. <p>The Labor Party, and in particular in South Australia through Mike Rann,the Leader of the Opposition, has always stood up for the Cyprus cause andto bring the injustice to the attention of the public.  Importantly, theissue has bipartisan support in Australia.  As politicians we can allperform a useful function by continuing to encourage discussion and seekre-unification of the island through the international community.  Inparticular, Australia must maintain its peacekeeping presence in Cyprus,and continue to seek the implementation of United Nation's Resolutions onthe problem.<p>History has taught us that people with passion and commitment for justicecan change the course of events.  Just as with the fall of the Berlin walland the collapse of the communist Soviet empire, it can take longer in somecases than others.  Greek and Turkish Cypriots lived and workedside-by-side for over 500 years until the 1974 invasion.  Withperseverance, patience and diplomatic pressure, Cyprus may reach a just andpeaceful solution to the scar that has divided the island.  <p><FONT SIZE="-1">* The title for this piece "oils ain't oils" reflects some interestingcomments made in Adelaide last week by visiting international speaker DrChris Ioannides from the Vryonis Centre for Hellenic Studies in SacramentoCalifornia.  Dr Ioannides ironically remarked on the lack of expediency bythe international community and the United States in particular, to resolvethe issue of Cyprus.  Unfortunately for Cyprus, it has an abundance ofgolden olive oil and not black crude oil.  Perhaps if it did, similarinternational resolve and outrage as seen in the Iraq-Kuwait conflict mayhave prevailed.</FONT><br clear=all><p><center><img src="http://www.electric.on.net/ads/ads_news/agriffiths_optometrist.gif" width=380 height=60 border=0></center><p><center><hr noshade><A HREF="http://www.electric.on.net"        onMouseOver="waxon('home');        statuson('home'); return true;"        onMouseOut="statusoff(); waxoff('home');        return true;"><IMG name=home SRC="../buttons/butt_home_off.gif" ALT="home" WIDTH="140" HEIGHT="32" BORDER="0"></a><A HREF="../essays/index.html"        onMouseOver="waxon('essays');        statuson('essays'); return true;"        onMouseOut="statusoff(); waxoff('essays');        return true;"><IMG name=essays SRC="../buttons/butt_essays_off.gif" ALT="essays" WIDTH="140" HEIGHT="32" BORDER="0"></a><hr noshade></center><p><A HREF="http://www.electric.on.net">http://www.electric.on.net</A><p>&copy; This work is subject to copyright.
