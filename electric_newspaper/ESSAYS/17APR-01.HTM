For overnight her torn,weeping skin would stick to the blood stained sheets in which she sleptEach morning her bedding would be doused with water before it was gentlypulled away from her tortured skin.<p>Aside from the relentless pain Janet Mills was constantly engulfed by thestench of decay. She lived with the smell of death - her own death. All shewanted to do was to meet that death.<p>For a brief period of time the Northern Territory gave her and others theopportunity to legally do so with much needed professional assistance. TheFederal Parliament closed that door when it passed the Andrews Bill. <p>Against the overwhelming tide of public opinion a majority of federalparliamentarians chose to turn back the clock. Most cited religious beliefsalthough I suspect more than a few were swayed by electoral considerations.Fear of the voters wrath is a more probable motivation for contemporaryp<p>oliticians than the threat of eternal damnation.This raises an interesting question. Why with public support for right tochoose VE running at between 70-80% should any politician fear an electoralbacklash? <p>The answer lies in the nature of the opposition to voluntary euthanasia. Itis largely the religious faithful who object. As it’s a matter of faiththey are more likely to break their traditional voting patterns over VE.Particularly if the churches were to actively campaign on the issue. Indeedthe Catholic Church pulled no punches in an expensive anti-VE crusade wagedin California.<p>Suddenly that 20-30% opposed looks like a very powerful voting blockindeed. Few seats would be considered safe in the face of concerted attacksfrom the churches. All lower house politicians are acutely aware of thedangers. I've had conversations with lower house members confirming this fact.<p>As a result of proportional representation upper house members are lesseasily targeted by pressure groups and consequently more likely to supportVE. A fact borne out in the voting for the Andrews Bill. The Senatenarrowly passed the Andrews Bill, the House of Representatives votedoverwhelmingly in favour of it.<p>Prior to the last state election I proposed a referendum on VE to be heldin conjunction with the October poll. My Bill was stone-walled by bothLabor and Liberal. Too divisive, too dangerous. <p>In place of the people being given a direct say it was decided to refer theissue to a select committee. The Legislative Council Select Committee onthe Voluntary Euthanasia Bill was convened and received some 3000submissions before the October election formally ended its terms of reference.<p>Carolyn Pickles MLC attempted to revive the VE Select Committee in theautumn sitting of State Parliament. The Council voted to refer the matterto the Social Development Committee rather than re-establish the VECommittee. <p>"Gutless wimps" I screamed.<p>Progress on this vital issue has been effectively stymied once again. TheSocial Development Committee is dominated by conservatives opposed to VE.Even if it was to start the inquiry now it would take 12 months to complete. <p>Hence the Social Development Committee won't be making any recommendationson this matter until well into the Parliamentary term. By then it will betoo late - too divisive, too dangerous, and preselection could be at stake.<p>I feel passionately about VE. It seems perverse that a person in dreadfulpain should be denied the right to choose the time of their death. It isequally perverse that doctors are placed in the agonising position ofbreaking the law to comply with their patient’s reasonable request.<p>Medical technology has extended the boundaries of what we called 'life'. Assuch, politicians should be required to grapple with the implications ofthese changed circumstances. At present too many of my colleagues are moreinterested in the concept of life than life itself.<p>Sadly, VE legislation is a long way off.<p><center><hr noshade><A HREF="http://www.electric.on.net"        onMouseOver="waxon('home');        statuson('home'); return true;"        onMouseOut="statusoff(); waxoff('home');        return true;"><IMG name=home SRC="../buttons/butt_home_off.gif" ALT="home" WIDTH="140" HEIGHT="32" BORDER="0"></a><A HREF="../essays/index.html"        onMouseOver="waxon('essays');        statuson('essays'); return true;"        onMouseOut="statusoff(); waxoff('essays');        return true;"><IMG name=essays SRC="../buttons/butt_essays_off.gif" ALT="essays" WIDTH="140" HEIGHT="32" BORDER="0"></a><hr noshade></center><p><A HREF="http://www.electric.on.net">http://www.electric.on.net</A><p>&copy; This work is subject to copyright.
