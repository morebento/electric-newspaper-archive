This terminologywas initially descriptive. Australians came from many parts of the world.Migration had expressed itself in our cities. Our tastes had expandedbeyond meat and two veg. The term "multi-cultural" was a simple adjective.<p>Over the last twenty years, intellectual elites, recognising the broadacceptance of this adjective, have colonised it by stealth. They haveinjected it with new meaning. Colonisation has many advantages over themore difficult task of introducing unfamiliar terminology. For a start, youdon't have to sell a new concept. You pick up adherents by inertia. <p>This colonisation process has now gone so far that adherents of"multi-culturalism" cling defiantly to highly individual personaldefinitions. "Multi-culturalism" now has so many facets as to have nospecific meaning. It has as many meanings as it has proponents anddetractors. The term serves to shroud debate in analogy or code. Thislanguage should be retired from the political lexicon and replaced withcrisper concepts about which debate can be openly focused.<p>The "multi-culturalism" conceptual bag is full of political dynamite.Because the bag was stuffed by linguistic stealth rather than debate, eachvolatile strand must be gingerly removed. Each must be examined, in somecases, for the first time. The biggest strands are labelled "populationpolicy", "immigration policy" and "cultural identity". If any evidence ofthis fact was required, the Queensland election result of last week-endbears consideration.<p>Australia has not had a debate about population policy since the end ofWorld War II. This debate raises a number of subsidiary issues, includingsustainable levels of population, distribution of population over thecontinent, national and regional development, and family, employment,immigration and economic policies.<p>Australia has not had a proper debate about immigration policy since theWar either. A blanket of elite consensus has been thrown  the subject. Theissues have not gone away - they have festered in the dark silence. OneNation seems set to destroy the elite consensus by raising issues directlywith the masses.<p>Immigration policy may or may not be debated in the broader context ofpopulation policy. There are a number of sub-plots here too, such as levelsof immigration,  sources of migrants, selection policies (eg. refugeeintake) and international obligations.<p>Cultural identity is the real sleeper. It is hard to define but itresonates in an electorate besieged by uncertainty. Ultimately this maybecome the defining issue in the looming political contest. What does itmean to be an Australian? What are our universal icons? Are we capable ofarticulating an inclusive culture based in reality?<p>"Multi-cultural" jargon has outlived its purpose. A new crisp focus, borneof genuine community values must emerge. Political leaders who cling to theredundant language of multi-culturalism will be side-lined in the comingdebate. The major parties will continue to vacate the field of ideas untilthis is acknowledged.       <p>HOWARD  IS  A  SLOW  LEARNER<p>John Howard hit the air-waves bright and early on Monday to put anacceptable spin on the devastation of his Queensland branch by cycloneHanson over the week-end. He had "heard the message" that people weredistressed by the pace and direction of change.<p>BUT there was still a good chance of a double dissolution, he was stillgoing to go ahead with a GST and he was still going to press on with thesale of the remaining two-thirds of Telstra.<p>Obviously John Howard needs to hear the message again and a lot louder.Paul Keating was thrown out in response to his policies of economicrationalism. It looks like John Howard wants to go the same way, and tomake One Nation a major player on the national stage in the process.<p>It takes a big man to admit that he is wrong and to make changes. It seemsthat John Howard is a small man after all.   <br clear=all><p><center><img src="http://www.electric.on.net/ads/ads_news/agriffiths_optometrist.gif" width=380 height=60 border=0></center><p><center><hr noshade><A HREF="http://www.electric.on.net"        onMouseOver="waxon('home');        statuson('home'); return true;"        onMouseOut="statusoff(); waxoff('home');        return true;"><IMG name=home SRC="../buttons/butt_home_off.gif" ALT="home" WIDTH="140" HEIGHT="32" BORDER="0"></a><A HREF="../essays/index.html"        onMouseOver="waxon('essays');        statuson('essays'); return true;"        onMouseOut="statusoff(); waxoff('essays');        return true;"><IMG name=essays SRC="../buttons/butt_essays_off.gif" ALT="essays" WIDTH="140" HEIGHT="32" BORDER="0"></a><hr noshade></center><p><A HREF="http://www.electric.on.net">http://www.electric.on.net</A><p>&copy; This work is subject to copyright.
