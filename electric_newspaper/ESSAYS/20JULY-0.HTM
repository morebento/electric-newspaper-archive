It's not a pretty sight.  <p>At the moment Labor Leader, Mike Rann is facing plenty of critics in theParliamentary Labor Party who are questioning his cynical stand on ETSAprivatisation.  As one Labor MP whispered in my ear recently, "He's playingKing Canute with his trousers rolled down!"  <p>Mr Rann is at his best darting and weaving with clever if not superficialone liners which are great for the eight-second grab on television news.But he is a bit like a scratchy ticket.  If you scratch him, more oftenthan not, there's nothing there!  <p>Just look at Mr Rann's record on economic issues.  As I have mentioned onmore than one occasion, he has no credentials and credibility in economicand financial management.  Mr Rann railed against the startup of RoxbyDowns and he lashed out against Liberal Party probing on the State Bankbefore its ignominious collapse in February 1991.<p>A lack of financial smarts - that's been the problem with the Labor Partyin South Australia for a long time.  Most of its members have been unionofficials, teachers or research officers with Labor Members of Parliament.Can you think of any Bannon/Arnold ministers who had any practical businessor financial background?  You wouldn't worry the scorer on that question.  <p>Now ask that question about the crop of 13 new ALP Members who came intoParliament after the October 1997 State election.  The Labor Party is stillrunning on empty, except for Terry Cameron MLC, who has a healthyunderstanding and appreciation of how business works.  He has had somepractical experience in the private sector and it shows in his questionsand speeches in the Parliament.  <p>Apparently this background is anathema to Mike Rann and Mr Cameron is verymuch on the outer.  Anyone observing proceedings in the Legislative Councilwould readily agree that Mr Cameron is by far and away the most effectiveand pugnacious Parliamentary performer for the Labor Party by a countrymile.  <p>Mr Rann's lack of financial savvy shows.  Anyone bothering to read his ninepage speech in reply to the recent State Budget would roll their eyes indisbelief.  There is plenty of rhetoric but no serious attempt toarticulate an alternative budget strategy.  Mr Rann apparently is under thedelusion the State is travelling easily.  He still has not recognised thefinancial hurt that South Australia suffered through the $4 billion oflosses in State Bank and SGIC.  Anyone who has had a severe financialsetback knows how tough it is to fight back.  For some it may take yearsand for others it will be a lifetime of misery.  The options for fixing amajor financial problem, whether it be for an individual, a business or aState, are limited.  In the case of debt, the solution is to massivelyincrease income and/or slash expenditure, or to sell an asset.  Mr Ranndoesn't seem to understand that point.  He has attacked the LiberalGovernment for increasing income and/or slashing expenditure and is nowcastigating them for selling assets to reduce debt.  Somehow Mr Rann thinksyou can just wind the altimeter back to zero on this sky-high State debtand step out without any parachute being required.  <p>Since the Liberal Party came to government in late 1993, developmentsaround the nation have meant that the State's difficult financial positionwill be exacerbated unless remedial action is taken.  South Australiaalready has by far the highest State debt per head of all mainland States.Queensland is debt-free and Victoria is heading that way in a hurry.  InNew South Wales you can write your own ticket on the fact that a decisionto privatise its electricity industry will be made after the March 1999State election irrespective of which party wins government.  New SouthWales will also be debt-free.  <p>So dear readers, you don't have to have an economics degree or even be anex-journalist like Mike Rann, to understand that South Australia will befighting the other States with one financial arm tied behind its economicback.  Our mainland State competitors will be able to devote every dollarin their budgets to vital services and support for their communities andbusiness sectors.  But in 1998/99 the South Australian Government can onlyspend 83.6 cents of every dollar it raises in taxes and charges because16.4 cents of this income goes in interest payments on debt.  Theseinterest payments for 1998/99 are estimated at $728 million.<p>I can't write any slower than this, but I think Mike Rann might get thedrift.  He can always ring me to discuss it if he doesn't understand.<p>And it is not only in the debt stakes that the world has moved on since1993.  The National Electricity Market has become a reality and will starton November 15, 1998.  It is a market, you will remember, created by, yes,a Federal Labor Government.  South Australia, Queensland, New South Wales,Victoria and the ACT will join the National Electricity Market when itopens.  <p>Victoria has already privatised its electricity industry.  It will happenin New South Wales next year and Queensland is also likely to follow.<p>Initially this National Electricity Market will allow the 27 majorconsumers of power in South Australia, such as WMC, General Motors andMitsubishi, (which together account for 17% of the State's electricity) tojoin the national grid and buy power from any source.<p>But in time everyone, including Mike Rann, will be able to buy power fromthis national market, which is expected to have up to 30 companiesretailing electricity in South Australia in competition with ETSA.  <p>Mike, the big questions which I would like to see you respond to in TheElectric Newspaper are - <p><ul>	<li>	Can Rann guarantee that ETSA's current profitability will remain 		undiminished in this new competitive National Electricity Market, 		which will be dramatically different from the monopoly position 		whichETSA now enjoys?	<li>	Can Rann guarantee that ETSA and Optima's sale value will		remain undiminished in the face of this new competitive National		Electricity Market?	<li>	Will Rann guarantee categorically that he will not sell ETSA and		Optima in the unlikely event of him becoming Premier after the		next State election?</ul><p>Mmm.  Very interesting questions, but the answers will be even moreinteresting and I am sure the readers will look forward to Mike's responsenext week.  <p>And while he's about it, Mike may also care to explain why he has refusedto call a convention of the ALP in this State to discuss this importantissue, given that it is nearly two years since the matter was lastaddressed.  <p>Mike, you might be a song and dance man, but there's no music playing.<br clear=all><p><center><img src="http://www.electric.on.net/ads/ads_news/agriffiths_optometrist.gif" width=380 height=60 border=0></center><p><center><hr noshade><A HREF="http://www.electric.on.net"        onMouseOver="waxon('home');        statuson('home'); return true;"        onMouseOut="statusoff(); waxoff('home');        return true;"><IMG name=home SRC="../buttons/butt_home_off.gif" ALT="home" WIDTH="140" HEIGHT="32" BORDER="0"></a><A HREF="../essays/index.html"        onMouseOver="waxon('essays');        statuson('essays'); return true;"        onMouseOut="statusoff(); waxoff('essays');        return true;"><IMG name=essays SRC="../buttons/butt_essays_off.gif" ALT="essays" WIDTH="140" HEIGHT="32" BORDER="0"></a><hr noshade></center><p><A HREF="http://www.electric.on.net">http://www.electric.on.net</A><p>&copy; This work is subject to copyright.
