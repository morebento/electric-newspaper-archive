We take ourfour weeks annual leave for granted, as something as sure as Sunday. Wenaturally expect to work 40 hours, or thereabouts, in a week and oursalaries are set in awards arising from negotiations entered into betweenemployers and workers represented by their unions.  Even if you're not aunion member, your pay and conditions are nonetheless set by the same awards.<p>	Even so, it's not just why I went. The MUA was out in force - people onmegaphones - "MUA, here to stay" - even as I mentioned to a friend, "thatmay be, but it's not entirely why I'm here".<p>	All of these reasons were perfectly good reasons to be out on the streetsand in truth, they were partly why I was there. I was there because of thedamage that was being done to the whole relationship between workers andemployers.  Workers throughout Australia were exposed to the possibilitythat the company or organisation with whom which we had entered into anemployment contract could, at the stroke of a lawyer's pen, absolvethemselves from any obligations that we  thought theymight have had, and sack us willy nilly, as they please, if they chose.<p>	The legal chicanery carried out by Patrick Stevedores, were it successful,would have provided the template for every other employer to follow, even ifthey were opposed to the implications underlying that course.  It would havebeen commercially necessary.<p>	When a company, the government and the unrepresentative executive of theNFF appear to conspire with each other to sack 1400 workers simply becausethey belong to a union, then one feels compelled to express opposition.Howard's"no worker will be worse off" promise in the last election campaign wasobviously "non core".  For an elected government to engage in this anti-constituent behaviour is deplorable and insulting.  Fortunately, we havesuch things as the separation of powers and consequently a relativelyindependent judicial system.  When a judge of that system  describes thegovernment's behaviour as "ignoble", then it's time for that government tohang it's head in shame.  <p>	This war against the MUA was simply a first step in the systematic removalof workers' rights across the board, and the removal of corporations'responsibility for and obligations to the workforce.  It has exposed someugly attitudes held by some employers regarding their employees.  The NSWpresident of the Chamber of Commerce made it clear where his sentiments layregarding the workforce.  How can a trusting, mutually respecting andharmonious industrial relationship exist when these attitudes prevail?  Howcan good come of divisiveness?  How can workers and employers trust eachother?  <p>	I guess I was there not only to show my support for the right to organise,but to say that our work is more than just exchange of labour for money,it's often a large part of our lives;  through it we develop trade andcareer skills, we develop personally and socially; through it we have achance to contribute to our society, and these things transcend legal andidealogical constructs.<p>	I was there in support of a workplace where the humans in it wererecognised. I hope that the High Court decision yesterday marks thebeginning of the return of commonsense and decency to the industriallandscape.<p><center><hr noshade><A HREF="http://www.electric.on.net"        onMouseOver="waxon('home');        statuson('home'); return true;"        onMouseOut="statusoff(); waxoff('home');        return true;"><IMG name=home SRC="../buttons/butt_home_off.gif" ALT="home" WIDTH="140" HEIGHT="32" BORDER="0"></a><A HREF="../essays/index.html"        onMouseOver="waxon('essays');        statuson('essays'); return true;"        onMouseOut="statusoff(); waxoff('essays');        return true;"><IMG name=essays SRC="../buttons/butt_essays_off.gif" ALT="essays" WIDTH="140" HEIGHT="32" BORDER="0"></a><hr noshade></center><p><A HREF="http://www.electric.on.net">http://www.electric.on.net</A><p>&copy; This work is subject to copyright.
