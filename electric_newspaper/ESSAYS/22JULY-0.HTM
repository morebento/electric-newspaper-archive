That is about where westand now. Either this Parliament - regardless of who the 47 members are -takes us down the road to darkness and contempt in the wider community, orwe decide that standards mean something and that the people who haveelected us here can rely on that point. <p>The House must be able to trust and rely on the information which Ministersprovide to it. It was an unfortunate mistake that Graham Ingerson made whenhe gave the answer he did to the question that was put to him, and he thenrepeated it.<p>The circumstances, as they have been portrayed today, invite me and all 47of us as Members of Parliament to consider whether or not we would put ourpersonal inclinations and feelings about one other member ahead of therespect which the public have, could have or should have for thisinstitution. We would put that ahead of our belief, in what I consider tobe, when I first joined the Liberal Party, the high tenets which LiberalParty members expect of those they endorse and elect toParliament, especially those who become Ministers in Liberal Governments.<p>I wonder whether or not we have to decide between our support forsomebody we know closely and personally, or our support for the trustthat the public must be able to have in the Parliament. Personally Icannot respond to that question, other than by saying that theinstitution of Parliament and the good government of the people throughthe processes of democracy must be paramount.<p>The Opposition these days is written up by journalists to be somethingmore tribal and engaging in a blood sport, and the Government on theother side of the Chamber has to reciprocate in kind or the journalistsdo not like it because it is not entertaining enough - they do not havesufficient controversy to report. That is sad, because it demeans theParliament and makes it seem more like a football game or some otherkind of sport. In fact, it is demeaned by implication in thesubconscious of the majority of the people as being even worse thansport, because in sport at least you have an independent umpire and youknow the rules. <p>It seems that too often the Parliament either does nothave or is unwilling to accept the view of an independent umpire, nordoes it have written rules by which it will conduct itself.<p>We have written rules on this side of the Chamber in Government. TheLiberal Party went to the last election with a clear-cut statement ofwhat those rules were. I do not need to quote them again - they havebeen quoted in the context of this debate already. It pains me that itis now seen as desirable to use sophistry to get around it. There was aconsequence, as another point in the remarks I make in relation to mybelief that this motion deserves the support of all 47 of us, forsomeone and some things as a result of that telephone call. Because RobHodge did not comply he paid the price and so did other people whosupported him. Whether that was necessary in the context of what wasdesirable for racing is beside the point. The end result is that RobHodge is no longer Chairman of the SAJC.<p>A point was made earlier in the course of the debate that the phone callfrom the Minister, the then Deputy Premier, to Rob Hodge, had noconsequences. Well, it did. Whether or not we could have achieved thesame result without the same changes in the personalities drivingracing, I do not know. Equally it does not really matter who is Ministerfor Racing as long as that person demonstrates a measure of competence inthe portfolio area, a measure of capacity and integrity as a Minister andof course then has the trust ofthis House. <p>In consequence of the findings of the privileges committee,it simply is not possible, no matter how much some people think it isso, no matter how much they wish it to be so, that his House hasconfidence in the Minister's ability to give it reliable information, togive it information in which it can place its trust.<p>So, it saddens me that we find ourselves having to debate theproposition because it was never necessary. If the first act ofmisleading the House has not occurred we would not be taking the timetoday to reflect upon what is meant by being elected to public office inthis place and given the responsibility of directing the way in whichthe State develops itself, the way in which the laws we make and theinformation upon which we base those laws is obtained. If we cannot relyon Ministers, who can we rely on? What kind of a Parliament will it be?<p>I ask all 46 other members how long do we expect thepublic to trust us if we do not act on the integrity of the information,regardless of what appears to be the consequences for us eachpersonally. It is about personal ambition and desire; it is not aboutmaking fields or enemies by about making improvements.<br clear=all><p><center><img src="http://www.electric.on.net/ads/ads_news/agriffiths_optometrist.gif" width=380 height=60 border=0></center><p><center><hr noshade><A HREF="http://www.electric.on.net"        onMouseOver="waxon('home');        statuson('home'); return true;"        onMouseOut="statusoff(); waxoff('home');        return true;"><IMG name=home SRC="../buttons/butt_home_off.gif" ALT="home" WIDTH="140" HEIGHT="32" BORDER="0"></a><A HREF="../essays/index.html"        onMouseOver="waxon('essays');        statuson('essays'); return true;"        onMouseOut="statusoff(); waxoff('essays');        return true;"><IMG name=essays SRC="../buttons/butt_essays_off.gif" ALT="essays" WIDTH="140" HEIGHT="32" BORDER="0"></a><hr noshade></center><p><A HREF="http://www.electric.on.net">http://www.electric.on.net</A><p>&copy; This work is subject to copyright.
