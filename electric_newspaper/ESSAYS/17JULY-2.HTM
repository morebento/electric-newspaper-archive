My comments related to thefact that despite seemingly insurmountable odds Graham Ingerson has managedto, in the past, not only survive, but indeed be promoted, when many otherMinisters would have been forced to resign.<p>Graham Ingerson has had a history of falling foul of the Opposition and themedia with respect to incidents which have raised questions as to whetheror not he misled the Parliament in his answers to various questions.Without going through all the details of them, they relate to his handlingof the tourism portfolio, as to whether or not he sought to use politicalinfluence with respect to the employment and attempted dismissal of certainpublic servants within that portfolio. This led to the celebrated publicstoush hehad with the former CEO of the Tourism Commission , Michael Gleeson, whoaccused him of political interference in the running of that Department.<p>That in turn led to a no confidence motion against him in the House ofAssembly, which he survived on Party lines. In addition of course, therehas been the ETSA $97 million write-down, which he claimed he had noknowledge of before reading its  Annual Report in December 1997, despitebeing its Minister when the ETSA board took its decision.<p>Ingo outside of the Parliamentary Chamber is quite an amiable person, andhis company is enjoyed by a number of Members on the Opposition benches.However,  his handling of his portfolios and in particular his predilectionto put his foot in his mouth at crucial times has bought a great deal ofjoy to the Labor Opposition, and despair to his own Party Members.<p>Indeed it is difficult to imagine why Ingo answered the questions put tohim by Labor's Opposition Treasury spokesperson Kevin Foley, on the MervHill issue, the way he did. He is an experienced politician and he musthave known that Kevin Foley already knew the answers to the questions hewas asking, and was waiting to see whether or not he would receivestraight-forward answers to those questions.<p>Ingo could have legitimately said that as the Minister for Racing, hewanted his views about Merv Hill to be taken into account by the RacingAuthority and that if the Racing Authority suffered as a result of MrHill's appointment as the CEO, then he (that is, Ingo) would "cop" theflack for it as the Minister for Racing, and therefore he had every rightto at least voice his views on whoever the successful applicant might be asCEO of SATRA.<p>Whilst that answer may have got him into some trouble for deliberatelyinvolving himself in the appointment of a person to a Statutory Authority,when he has no responsibility or right at law to do so, at least it wouldhave been a straight answer, and one which would have barely caused aripple in the morning press.<p>Of course the rest of the story is history, in that as a result of Ingo'sanswers, both in the Estimates Committee of the House of Assembly, and inthe Parliament itself, a Privileges Committee has been established by theParliament to determine as to whether or not Ingo misled the Parliament.<p>This is the first time in 140 years of self government in South Australiathat a Privileges Committee has been set up to investigate such a matterwith respect to a Minister of the Crown.<p>Ingo, effectively, was required to resign as Deputy Premier. Some Liberalstrategists believed that they would be able to sell to the LiberalIndependents and the National Party, who hold the balance of power in theHouse of Assembly, that that was a sufficient penalty for Graham Ingerson.<p>That of course isn't the case. Whilst the loss of the Deputy Premiershipmeans a loss of status for him, the fact of the matter is he remains asenior Minister, with a senior portfolio in the Olsen Government,(Industry, Trade and Tourism) and as far as his pay is concerned he hasonly suffered an $8,000 per annum pay cut, which is mere postage money fora person with Mr Ingerson's financial standing.<p>The Labor Opposition could barely contain its glee that the Liberal Partyagain failed to act decisively to stop their internal haemorrhaging.Keeping Graham Ingerson on the front bench mortally wounded is the bestthing any political opposition party could have going for it.<p>Can Ingo get out of the burning warehouse this time? It would look unlikelyat this stage, the loss of the Deputy Premiership meant that he got singedby the fires raging around him, but he has not been consumed within thatburning warehouse yet and I am sure that he is furtively, but frantically,looking for that one last escape hatch which he has always found in thepast. However on this occasion I think the trap door is firmly latched.<p>From rumours around the corridors of Parliament House, it would appear thatno deal has been done with the so called Independents and therefore GrahamIngerson and the Liberal Party would seem to be steeling themselves for anadverse finding against him, by the Privileges Committee, at least by amajority of them, when they report to the House of Assembly next Tuesdaywhen Parliament again resumes.<p>If Graham Ingerson resigns or is forced to resign from the Ministry, wheredoes he go then? He could of course whittle away his time on the Governmentbackbench until the next State election. However, that seems unlikely in myview, knowing the person. <p>If he is to leave the Parliament at a convenient time to the OlsenGovernment, it may be to assume some other public office or sinecurebefitting a person of his standing within the Liberal Party. If thathappens there would be a by-election in what would normally be regarded asa rock solid safe Liberal seat of Bragg.<p>Bragg, which covers the eastern suburbs such as Burnside, is hardly likelyto revolt against the Olsen Government in sufficient numbers to see a LaborParty member elected in that seat. However, what would be interesting isthe internal faction fighting which will inevitably engulf the LiberalParty as to whether a wet or a dry, an Olsen supporter or a Brown supporteror whatever other shade of colour of opinion they have in the LiberalParty, will succeed Graham Ingerson, as the Liberal Party standard bearerin Bragg. <p>What should also worry the Liberal Party is not only the opening again ofall the factional rifts that they have within their Party, but as towhether or not an Independent Liberal or just an Independent running inBragg might not make a significant dent in the Liberal Party vote in thatseat. We have seen  Independent Liberal's in formerly safe Liberal seats ofMcKillop and Gordon in the South East, and we have seen in Jeff Kennett'sheartland of Victoria in Gippsland West that a formerly safe Liberal seatwas lost to an Independent, who was formerly the Labor Party candidate forthat same seat in the 1996 State election.<p>A large swing away from the Olsen Liberal Government in such Toryheartland, even if the Liberal Party wins a by election in Bragg, would bea major blow to an already morale deadened Liberal Government and would putfurther pressure on John Olsen's leadership.<p>A win by an Independent of any particular political flavouring would be anabsolute nightmare for John Olsen and the Liberal Party, and wouldcertainly end Olsen's leadership.<p>Whilst it may be premature to be writing Graham Ingerson's obituary, Ishould also in fairness to him point out that when he was Minister forIndustrial Affairs, he got through a number of significant pieces oflegislation, such as a major overhaul of the old Industrial Relations Act,giving rise to non union enterprise agreements being able to be made in theState award system. There were significant changes to the WorkCoverlegislation which saw benefits to injured workers significantly reduced, ata cost saving to employers, and he introduced changes to the shop tradinghours legislation which allowed for the extension of Sunday trading in thecentral business district of Adelaide.<p>Each of these pieces of legislation were hard fought over, I should know, Iwas the Opposition Shadow person responsible for opposing those pieces oflegislation, and Ingerson achieved those changes by badgering, cajoling,threatening and flattering the Australian Democrats in the LegislativeCouncil.<p>When I first entered State Parliament in December 1993, Graham Ingersongave me a wise piece of advise which I should have listened to with greaterattentiveness, when he told me that "Ralph, not all of your enemies sitopposite you in the Chamber". This statement is a political truism asrelevant today as any other time in our political history.<br clear=all><p><center><img src="http://www.electric.on.net/ads/ads_news/agriffiths_optometrist.gif" width=380 height=60 border=0></center><p><center><hr noshade><A HREF="http://www.electric.on.net"        onMouseOver="waxon('home');        statuson('home'); return true;"        onMouseOut="statusoff(); waxoff('home');        return true;"><IMG name=home SRC="../buttons/butt_home_off.gif" ALT="home" WIDTH="140" HEIGHT="32" BORDER="0"></a><A HREF="../essays/index.html"        onMouseOver="waxon('essays');        statuson('essays'); return true;"        onMouseOut="statusoff(); waxoff('essays');        return true;"><IMG name=essays SRC="../buttons/butt_essays_off.gif" ALT="essays" WIDTH="140" HEIGHT="32" BORDER="0"></a><hr noshade></center><p><A HREF="http://www.electric.on.net">http://www.electric.on.net</A><p>&copy; This work is subject to copyright.
