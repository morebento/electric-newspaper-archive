It arose in southern Sumatra, andlike the Dutch who came so much later was maritime in character. In thefifth, sixth, and seventh centuries AD, Srivijaya controlled the sea routesof the Malacca and Sunda Straits. In time Srivijaya extended its influenceinto the coastal areas of western Java and the Malay peninsular. <p>In part simultaneously with Srivijaya, a series of kingdoms emerged inJava. Whereas Srivijaya was a maritime empire, these were based on thecontrol of irrigated rice fields. The first was Mataram, in central Java,which flourished at the beginning of the eighth century. This was followedin the 10th century by Airlangga, whose control extended to Bali. At least18 greater and lesser kingdoms followed, including the Madjaphit,Djanggala, and finally the Mataram re-emerged as a power in central Java.Its sultan extended power from Kalimantan to Sumatra, and things werelooking good for the Mataram expansionists until they kept bumping intoEuropean traders, who were buying cloves and selling them in Amsterdam fora profit of 2,500 per cent.<p>But the Dutch weren't the only Europeans. The Portuguese came first, at thebeginning of the 16th century, and by 1511 Malacca was in their control.Next came the Spaniards in 1521, and the first Englishman was Sir FrancesDrake, who circled the globe in 1577-80, visiting Halmahera and Java. TheDutch were late arrivals in 1596. <p>The Portuguese wanted only to establish fortress trading posts. This theydid at Ambon, Ternate, and Timor. The Spanish were simply passing throughon their way to the Philippines. The Dutch, however, had more seriousintentions. After four years of preliminary voyaging, they too set uptrading bases, and then sought to develop a monopoly. They forced out thePortuguese by 1641, fought an unofficial war with the English, and thenencountered difficulties in enforcing their desires for monopoly on thelocal rulers. <p>By force, and by the end of the 17th century, the Dutch were the undisputedmasters in the archipelago.<p>Even so, the Dutch East India Company's policy was trade, not militaryincursions. Military action was rightly seen as expensive and interruptive.Local rebellions still broke out sporadically and the Dutch had still,reluctantly, to crush them.  As often as not, the Dutch intervened in localwars between rival Javanese kingdoms, and there were also Chinese migranttroubles in Java. Chinese settlers had been in the archipelago since beforethe coming of the Portuguese, but their increasing numbers brought violentreaction from the Javanese. In 1740 some 10,000 Chinese died in ten days ofbloody massacre, which the Dutch could have halted.<p>The British came in next. The King of the Netherlands had fled the war withFrance - arriving in England with a suitcase and a few vassals. Britaintook over in the Far East. Thomas Stamford Raffles became LieutenantGovernor of Java and its dependencies. The Dutch moved back in 1815, butfor the next 40 years sporadic resistance broke out in Sumatra, Java,southern Kalimantan, southern Sulawesi, Ternate, Aambon, Lombok, and Bali.<p>Then Japan marched in, and things got really bad for everyone - for theDutch there (some families had lived in the Indies for three hundred years,longer than whites have been in Australia), for the Chinese, the Sumatrans,and the people of the other islands. <p>When the Japanese slunk back out, defeated, the war-time puppet Governmentheaded by Java's Dr Sukarno was poised to fill the vacuum. This he did,against Dutch wishes but with Australian support, and then followed not afederation of independent States, but a new Javanese empire, more ruthless(the Japanese excepting) than the region had seen for many centuries. <p>The various parts of the archipelago had never felt ‘Indonesian'. They sawthemselves as Sumatran, for example, not Indonesian. The stone-agehunter-gatherers in West Irian had nothing in common with the Balinese, orthe people of the Malay peninsular. <p>The Javanese warriors took over an entire archipelago and its differentpeoples, its different languages - there are 25 major languages and two tothree hundred variations spoken - its different religions, and itsdifferent cultures and histories.<p>Local rebellions against the new colonialists began, and were suppressed asthey still are  in East Timor. While Timor is the latest and best knownexample of Javanese military domination of the region, it is certainly notthe first, nor the second, nor the third.<p>Indonesia is an artificial empire, forged from the ruins of the SecondWorld War, and ruled from Jakarta with only token local autonomy.<p>And yet, it is generally at peace. <p>Autocratic rule has not meant complete misery, as the region has known atother time of its long history. Bribery and official corruption has notmeant crime in the streets. ‘Indonesia' is a Greek word, meaning EastIndian Islands. It is a mixture of East and West. It is a vast land, ofpolluted cities and vast rainforests, of sparkling coral reefs and canalswhich run as cesspools, of magic and mystery, violence and blood. <p>Indonesia is a lesson in nationalism, international intrigue, and survival. <p><font size=-1>*Hendrik Gout was Made in Indonesia</font><p><center><hr noshade><A HREF="http://www.electric.on.net"        onMouseOver="waxon('home');        statuson('home'); return true;"        onMouseOut="statusoff(); waxoff('home');        return true;"><IMG name=home SRC="../buttons/butt_home_off.gif" ALT="home" WIDTH="140" HEIGHT="32" BORDER="0"></a><A HREF="../essays/index.html"        onMouseOver="waxon('essays');        statuson('essays'); return true;"        onMouseOut="statusoff(); waxoff('essays');        return true;"><IMG name=essays SRC="../buttons/butt_essays_off.gif" ALT="essays" WIDTH="140" HEIGHT="32" BORDER="0"></a><hr noshade></center><p><A HREF="http://www.electric.on.net">http://www.electric.on.net</A><p>&copy; This work is subject to copyright.
