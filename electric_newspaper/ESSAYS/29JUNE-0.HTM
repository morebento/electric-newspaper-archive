The world is shrinking.  The waywe do things is changing.  <p>This weekend many South Australians will watch World Cup Soccer matcheslive from France on SBS television or race meetings around Australia liveon Sky television.  Others will surf the net and buy books from the AmazonBookstore in the USA.  People planning holidays may book through the net.All these examples have an impact on the economy and employment.  Theability to watch races in the comfort of a pub or with the aid of teletextbetting at home has put pressure on attendances at race meetings.  Whathappens to bookstores in Adelaide competing against the growing percentageof books being sold through the net?  Indeed, it is suggested that the netaccounts for up to 20% of all books sold in America.  And what happens toSouth Australian travel agents faced with this cyberspace competition?  Andhow do governments collect taxes on cyberspace transactions?<p>You haven't heard the Australian Democrats talking about these things.  Andwhy not?  These changes in information and communication technology willdestroy jobs in this State.  And if South Australia is not alert to thisdanger and does not work hard to create new jobs , then it will slide offthe map of Australia.  <p>Put simply, South Australia has to be competitive.  And power costs can bea very important component in creating a competitive economy.  <p>So there is a paradox.  The Democrats embrace and recognise change inglobal communications by using the net to proudly trumpet their decisionagainst the proposed privatisation of ETSA and Optima.  But they ignore thereality of what is happening in the commercial world.  Yes, change ishappening there too.  The National Electricity Market, established courtesyof a Federal Labor Government, will see State boundaries disappear.Initially large South Australian employers such as Mitsubishi or WMC willbe able to buy electricity from interstate if the price is right.  In timeelectricity will be like a supermarket commodity.  Merv and Melba Metro ofMelrose Park may in fact be able to buy electricity through the supermarket.  <p>In many countries electricity has long been the province of the privatesector.  Labor, shortly before it lost government in South Australia in1993, flogged off the State's controlling interest in the South AustralianGas Company.  A de facto privatisation of an energy utility.  Mike Rann wasthere for that decision.  At least he got that one right!  So why now is heagainst the privatisation of ETSA, when all other States are moving in thatdirection?  And why are the Australian Democrats ignoring the reality ofthe National Electricity Market?  Do they really think that South Australiashould hang on to ETSA, which ultimately may be the only government-ownedpower utility on the eastern seaboard, and expect it to compete againstprivate sector owned power utilities?  And if ETSA remains in public hands,where will the money come from for additional capital expenditure requiredto upgrade or refurbish our power sector assets?  The Democrats' analysisof their decision to reject the privatisation of ETSA and Optima includesno discussion of that very significant point.<p>The Democrats reject the arguments of the well-respected Tom Sheridan, aformer Auditor General and Deputy Under Treasurer in South Australia, andinstead prefer to accept the report of Professor John Quiggin of James CookUniversity and John Spoehr of Adelaide University, who were commissioned toprovide a report by the United Trades & Labour Council, the Public ServiceAssociation and CEPU and ASU. No-one has yet showed me any evidence of Quiggin and Spoehr ever sayinganything nice about privatisation.  And why don't the Democrats quote theviews of the business community in this matter?  <p>The Democrats, in publishing their reasons for opposing privatisation,claim the South Australian Liberal Government "has an ideological obsessionwith the level of debt".  Some facts may help put the matter of debt inperspective.  Victoria has slashed its debt through privatisation and hasachieved a AAA credit rating, which reduces the interest rate it pays onany borrowings.  Queensland's debt is minuscule.  The New South Wales LaborGovernment is also committed to massive debt reduction through theprivatisation of its power companies.  So dear reader are you as relaxed asthe Democrats at the prospect of South Australia competing against thosethree eastern States, which each will have dramatically lower debt percapita, better credit ratings and much deeper purses to attract and supportbusiness and provide monies for health, education and other vital services? The irresistible conclusion is that the lentil soup is talking!  <p>So globalisation to the Democrats is terrific if it involves the internetor the South Australian wine industry breaking into new markets overseasand clobbering other countries.  <p>But when it comes to the reality of arguably the biggest game in town, theyput on their knitted cardigans, light the candles, reach for their quillpens and draw a moat around the map of South Australia.  <br clear=all><p><center><img src="http://www.electric.on.net/ads/ads_news/agriffiths_optometrist.gif" width=380 height=60 border=0></center><p><center><hr noshade><A HREF="http://www.electric.on.net"        onMouseOver="waxon('home');        statuson('home'); return true;"        onMouseOut="statusoff(); waxoff('home');        return true;"><IMG name=home SRC="../buttons/butt_home_off.gif" ALT="home" WIDTH="140" HEIGHT="32" BORDER="0"></a><A HREF="../essays/index.html"        onMouseOver="waxon('essays');        statuson('essays'); return true;"        onMouseOut="statusoff(); waxoff('essays');        return true;"><IMG name=essays SRC="../buttons/butt_essays_off.gif" ALT="essays" WIDTH="140" HEIGHT="32" BORDER="0"></a><hr noshade></center><p><A HREF="http://www.electric.on.net">http://www.electric.on.net</A><p>&copy; This work is subject to copyright.
