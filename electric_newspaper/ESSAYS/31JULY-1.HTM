I wassatisfied Tom Dewey would win the (U.S.) presidency; which goes to showwhat extraordinary results can happen in a country like the U.S. sobackward as not to have compulsory voting." (R. G. Menzies, reported in New York 1960)<p>The above quote made at the end of my contribution to the Abolition ofCompulsory Voting Amendment Bill 1998, elicited a number of interjectionfrom Government members.  They seemed to find it incredulous that noneother than the founding father of the Liberal Party (and longest servingAustralian Prime Minister) was a supporter of compulsory voting.  <p>For the fourth time since 1993, the Government has introduced a Bill toabolish compulsory voting in South Australia.  This is hardly the issue ofour time and there are certainly more pressing issues which should beaddressed by Parliament.  The One Nation inroads in the Queensland electionhas strengthened my views that now more than ever, there should be a moraland legal obligation on all citizens to exercise their hard fought right tovote at every election.  <p>Compulsory voting, I believe, allows every citizen to decide whether tovote for a particular person or party or vote for no-one at all (by simplyattending, having their name crossed off the roll and placing the blankballot paper in the box).  It does not leave the process to, for example,people motivated by whipped-up self-interest or populist doctrine that isoften lacking in substance.  In other words, it provides real choice forall citizens.<p>No doubt a large number of complex factors are involved as to whatmotivates people to vote or not where voting is voluntary.  The mix ofthose factors may vary from country to country.  No doubt apathy anddisillusionment are major factors.  But more importantly, however, a largenumber of voters become marginalised by political parties targeting onlythe people most likely to vote. <p>In the United States voluntary voting leads to the poor, pensioners and theyoung (especially those voting for the first time) being wiped off the database or to never make the data base - as politicians work out who is notlikely to vote and hone in on those who are likely to.<p>In the recent Constitutional Convention, just under 40% of electorsbothered to vote, even though it was a relatively convenient postal ballot. The ballot was the brainchild of South Australian Senator Nick Minchin,the champion of the voluntary voting system, and showed again what a shamvoluntary voting would be for the democratic process.  <p>The amount of money expended on administrative and court costs are given asa reason for abolishing voluntary voting.  But this cost is only a smallpart of the overall cost of elections - but in any case the question shouldbe:  what price does one place on democracy?<p>More importantly, I am sure that the overwhelming majority of theapproximately 95% of people who normally vote, do not do so because theyare terrified of being fined if they don't.  They vote for the most partbecause it is a civic duty and part of the democratic process, even ifthere is a legal requirement in the Electoral Act to do so.<p>This is an important point - democratic communities do not function becauseof compulsion, but because of cooperation and the sense of community andcivil responsibility.  Yes, we have our myriad laws which regulatevirtually every aspect of our society, including the obligation to vote.But it is not compulsion which makes it work, otherwise we would need theproverbial police presence on every corner.  <p>I like to use the analogy of the Adelaide City Council erecting a 'keep offthe grass' sign in order to maintain an area of lawn.  In our community 95%will respect that sign not because of the threat of sanctions, but becauseof our civic pride and that there would not be any lawn if thousands ofpeople walked on it.  There would probably be little impact if a few peopleignored the sign, but occasionally Council inspectors will question peoplewalking across the lawn and if they don't have a legitimate reason or keepdoing it, will issue an expiation notice.<p>Unlike the Liberal Party which is split on this issue, the Labor Party hasalways had a strong history of supporting compulsory voting.  The divisionsin the Liberal Party were demonstrated by the Federal Member for Hindmarshin a recent newspaper column.  She listed the usual arguments regarding thelow voter turnout at voluntary local government elections, the UnitedStates example where the President of that country is elected by less thana quarter of US citizens, and the temptation for political parties toprioritise their policies to those more likely to vote.  The memberconcluded: "Those who advocate voluntary voting should remember thatcompulsory voting has served us well.  Despite the growing gap between therich and the poor, it has kept us together as a cohesive society, and ithas kept at bay special interest groups who would seek to control thepolitical process and the politicians."<p>Even more telling comments were made at the Victorian Liberal Party'sOctober 1997, 126th State Council held in Shepparton and reported in TheAustralian  - 90% of the 500-strong delegates carried a motion whichlabeled the concept of voluntary voting a "disaster" for democracy.  Theimmediate past president of the Victorian branch of the Liberal party wasquoted as saying that "compulsory voting was a fundamental part of thenation's political culture and heritage, and he believed the majority ofLiberal members recognised it should be strongly upheld."<p>Australia shares compulsory voting with well over 30 other democracies inthe world.  Significantly, Greece which invented democracy thousands ofyears ago, has compulsory voting.  There is no doubt in my mind thatvoluntary voting increases the likelihood of inducements and undueinfluences being offered to voters to get them to vote.  I believe it isimportant for parties to concentrate on what they can offer to theelectorate, rather than how to induce voters to get them to the polls. <p>Although there are minor differences between Federal and State votingsystems, they do have a common electoral roll.  Given that the Federalgovernment does not appear to have any intention of changing the currentsystem, one can imagine the voter confusion if one had a voluntary systemand the other a compulsory system.<p>We should remember that only 25 years ago the Liberal Party was stillfighting to ensure that Legislative Council voters needed to be propertyfranchisees.  Voluntary voting could produce similar unrepresentativeresults prior to the reforms by the Dunstan Government.  <p>As a woman it also concerns me that if the Government is successful in thislegislation, it would no doubt reduce the number of people who would play apart in the community life of this State.  I regret to say that there arestill women in our community in 1998 who may not be given the opportunityto go out to vote if it is not considered essential for them to do so.This would certainly be a retrograde step for a State which introduced thefranchise for women in 1894. <p>One is led to conclude that the reason for persisting with this legislationis nothing more than Liberal Party self-interest, given the lack ofcommunity interest or support for this issue.  <p>For a democracy to be a democracy, it means majority rule and theexpression of opinion by the majority of its electors.  Compulsory votinghas and does serve our democracy well. <br clear=all><p><center><img src="http://www.electric.on.net/ads/ads_news/agriffiths_optometrist.gif" width=380 height=60 border=0></center><p><center><hr noshade><A HREF="http://www.electric.on.net"        onMouseOver="waxon('home');        statuson('home'); return true;"        onMouseOut="statusoff(); waxoff('home');        return true;"><IMG name=home SRC="../buttons/butt_home_off.gif" ALT="home" WIDTH="140" HEIGHT="32" BORDER="0"></a><A HREF="../essays/index.html"        onMouseOver="waxon('essays');        statuson('essays'); return true;"        onMouseOut="statusoff(); waxoff('essays');        return true;"><IMG name=essays SRC="../buttons/butt_essays_off.gif" ALT="essays" WIDTH="140" HEIGHT="32" BORDER="0"></a><hr noshade></center><p><A HREF="http://www.electric.on.net">http://www.electric.on.net</A><p>&copy; This work is subject to copyright.
