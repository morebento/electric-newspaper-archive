How did a fledglingparty with little money and only one elected member in another parliamentachieve this result?<p>Unprecedented amounts of media coverage for a third party provides is asignificant part of the explanation. Deep dissatisfaction with theCoalition and Labor parties accounts for much of the rest.<p>The media coverage began when Pauline won the Labor seat of Oxley as thedis-endorsed Liberal candidate. The Liberals dumped her in the middle ofthe campaign for making racist remarks. The media's interest wasimmediately aroused.<p>Pauline's red hair, gender and simple style of speaking fuelled thisinterest. But the match that lit the Hanson media bonfire was her cunninginaugural speech Federal Parliament.<p>So what did she say to the House of Representatives on Tuesday the 10th ofSeptember 1996? Briefly, Pauline told us she entered Parliament not “as apolished politician but as a woman who has had her fair share of life'sknocks."<p>She then preceded to outline a series of grievances that pretty muchencompassed contemporary Australia's fears and prejudices. In turn Paulineattacked Aboriginal welfare, unemployment and official attempts to disguiseits real level, the Family Law Act, the privatisation of Telstra,immigration, multiculturalism, foreign aid, tariff reductions and the levelof interest rates.<p>In between we were told “to survive in peace and harmony, united andstrong, we must have one people, one nation." After listing the respectivepopulations of Japan, China, India, Indonesia and Malaysia, Pauline thentold us we are in danger of being swamped by Asians. Exploitation of fearof the ‘yellow peril' is alive and well.<p>It wasn't all invective and insinuated dangers. The Adelaide to Darwinrailway line was promoted as the type of project needed for nationaldevelopment and she advocated national service for all males and femalesreaching 18 years of age.<p>The Member for Oxley finished by exhorting Australians to ‘wake up'.<p>From that moment on the media has displayed a prurient interest in thefortunes and utterances of Pauline. It's notable the media coverage of theinaugural speech focused almost exclusively on her views about  Aboriginesand Asians.<p>The Prime Minister did his bit to keep the ball rolling, proclaiming an endto political correctness and the virtues of free speech. Australian's loveof a sideshow did the rest. <p>Given the list of grievances dealt with in Pauline's inaugural speech it'seasy to understand the oft-heard suggestion that ‘whilst I don't agree witheverything she says she's right about some things'. <p>Indeed the Democrats share common ground with One Nation. We too support areduction in immigration although not for fear of being swamped by Asians.The Democrats believe this ancient dry land can only support a limitedpopulation no matter what their colour or creed.<p>The Democrats are also in the forefront of calls for greater regulation offoreign capital and have been instrumental in alerting Australians to thedangers of the Multilateral Agreement on Investment.<p>We also oppose the privatisation of Telstra and have consistently opposedthe imposition of extremist competition policy. <p>But the Democrats also stand for a racially tolerant, multicultural,inclusive Australia. Not very sexy in media terms. Nothing new or unusualor provocative, or divisive in that stance. Not like beating the race drum.<p>As a result of her inflammatory views, for a time, Pauline seemed to beeverywhere - television, radio, newspapers and magazines. When the media'sinterest did wane Pauline appeared on national television telling us “whenyou see this you will know I have been murdered". <p>I read that as a political suicide note. It wasn't and, courtesy of acynical preference strategy by Queensland's Coalition parties, One Nationagain found itself the centre of media attention in the lead up to theQueensland election. <p>Again the Prime Minister weighed in on behalf of One Nation's vote when heentered the campaign to call Pauline ‘deranged'. That ill-consideredoutburst only added fuel to the electoral bonfire that was consuming theOld National Party.<p>At the last South Australian poll the Democrats received 16.4% of theprimary vote. That was achieved with minimal media coverage. With just a skerrick moremedia attention we too would have broken into the Lower House. What wewon't do is to peddle nonsense and promote division to increase our vote.<p>Australia can't afford it. <br clear=all><p><center><img src="http://www.electric.on.net/ads/ads_news/agriffiths_optometrist.gif" width=380 height=60 border=0></center><p><center><hr noshade><A HREF="http://www.electric.on.net"        onMouseOver="waxon('home');        statuson('home'); return true;"        onMouseOut="statusoff(); waxoff('home');        return true;"><IMG name=home SRC="../buttons/butt_home_off.gif" ALT="home" WIDTH="140" HEIGHT="32" BORDER="0"></a><A HREF="../essays/index.html"        onMouseOver="waxon('essays');        statuson('essays'); return true;"        onMouseOut="statusoff(); waxoff('essays');        return true;"><IMG name=essays SRC="../buttons/butt_essays_off.gif" ALT="essays" WIDTH="140" HEIGHT="32" BORDER="0"></a><hr noshade></center><p><A HREF="http://www.electric.on.net">http://www.electric.on.net</A><p>&copy; This work is subject to copyright.
