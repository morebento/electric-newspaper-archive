I spoke of ouropposition, in principle, to the disposal of these valuable State assets. Ispoke about the opposition of ordinary country people to the Government'splans to sell-off ETSA and Optima. I spoke about the growing number ofrepresentations I have had from country electricity consumers, bothdomestic and commercial, who have had unacceptable service, supply anddelivery delays and problems with ETSA. <p>In the weeks and months since I first raised the issue of ETSA's decliningservice capabilities and levels, the extent of the problem that ETSA facesin adequately servicing country areas has been made much clearer to me. Ihave had numerous representations from electricity consumers in myelectorate and elsewhere. <p>Almost without exception, these country electricity consumers havedocumented histories of long delays and problems in electricity connectionand service provision. I ask the Premier, is it a coincidence that theseproblems have arisen almost in direct proportion to the steady cutbacks inETSA's staffing and resource levels in country areas? The answer of courseis that it's no coincidence. As country people know only too well frompersonal experience, resource cutbacks mean fewer services and a fight justto get access to those that remain.<p>Since the Government's decision to sell ETSA, the National Party has had along and hard look at the issues for and against the sale. We have listenedto the case for selling put by the Premier and Treasurer, and theiradvisors, and we have studied the various arguments and submissions putbefore the Economic and Finance Committee inquiry into electricity reform.We have studied industry submissions and listened to their arguments onboth sides.<p>We acknowledge that there are respectable arguments and reasons forprivatising some of the State's electricity assets. But at the end of theday, it is necessary to measure and weigh all the competing arguments forand against selling State assets and come to a decision. <p>Our job of assessing the arguments has been made all the harder by theGovernment's refusal to provide virtually any of the real informationneeded to independently make our assessment.<p>There has, however, been no shortage of misinformation and propaganda fromthe Government. <p>In the category of misinformation, I include much of what has been said bythe Government about existing and potential risks to the South Australianelectricity industry in the future. <p>No one could seriously argue that the deregulated national market holds norisks for the South Australian companies involved in electricitygeneration, transmission and supply. To some extent, the risks are beingoversold by the Government in order to bolster the sale case. But moreimportantly, the likely effect of the risks on ETSA and Optima, and the wayto best handle the risk, is being misrepresented by the Government, inorder to support the case for selling ETSA and Optima.<p>We are warned by the Government that the overall effect of the variousunavoidable risks that the industry faces in the future will be a reductionin the likely future profit of ETSA and Optima, and hence a reduction inthe flow of dividends to Government revenue. <p>It is argued that we should sell the assets as quickly as possible, beforethe extent of a profit squeeze fully emerges. Only if we sell quickly, sowe're told, can we avoid the inevitable decrease in the value of ETSA andOptima that lower profitability will lead to.<p>There's an obvious flaw in this analysis. The potential buyers of ETSA andOptima assets will have factored all such projected profit declines intoany assessment of the value of the assets. And these buyers will pitchtheir tenders or bids for the assets at an accordingly reduced price. <p>So what are we to conclude? Either that the Government is commerciallynaive because it assumes that potential buyers won't factor all futurerisks into the price they are prepared to pay. Or that the Government isdetermined to sell ETSA and Optima assets at a price which is heavilydiscounted but which is high enough to allow it to patch up, for a time atleast, the now revealed blow-out in the State's finances.<p>Whether the sale of ETSA and Optima would, in any case, turn around thecrisis in South Australia's finances is the seven billion dollar question,and I want to return to that question in a moment.<p>First, however, there is another risk myth that needs to be exploded. TheGovernment argues that existing and likely regulatory and competitionpolicy pressures and risks will impact severely on the market value of ourETSA and Optima assets. These competition and regulatory risks are said tobe inappropriate for the South Australian taxpayer to bear, as shareholdersof ETSA and Optima. The better solution, according to the Government, isfor South Australians to be protected from risk by disposing of the assets,and sooner rather than later. <p>This is a nonsense argument, no matter which way the price of electricitygoes in the future. If the future market price of electricity rises, as aresult of the move to a national electricity market, then South Australiantaxpayers, as owners of ETSA and Optima, would see an increase in thecapital value of their assets. <p>But if the assets are sold off, then the windfall capital gain from anelectricity price increase would go entirely to the shareholders, as ownersof the assets. It could also be reasonably expected that there would be anincrease in dividends payable to the owner of the assets, be they SouthAustralian taxpayers, or shareholders, as increasing electricity prices arereflected in increasing profitability of ETSA and Optima.<p>And of course, no matter who owns ETSA and Optima and despite all theGovernment's assurances to the contrary, if the price of electricityincreases, then we can predict with absolute confidence that most countryconsumers in South Australia will be paying higher prices, on average, fortheir electricity, and that the price differential between electricity unitprices to consumers in the suburbs of Adelaide compared to consumers inWaikerie or Berri, will increase from its current level. <p>At best, the Government will have some say over pricing only for the nextfour and a half years. After that, country consumers have been wooed by thepromise of guaranteed Government subsidies until 2013, apparently to befunded from the sale proceeds.<p>But the real power over pricing will be in the hands of federal Governmentagencies. As consumers at the non-contestable end of the market, mostcountry people in South Australian and elsewhere, will be price-takers ofthe most powerless kind. The expensive bureaucracy the Government intendsto establish to oversee the State electricity market wont have any power toaffect fundamental pricing decisions. This power will subsist elsewhere,beyond the reach of the South Australian Government.<p>Those who say that the situation a few years down the track will be nodifferent in practical terms from what we have now, completely miss thepoint. We now have at least a minimum level of accountability through theballot box. At the moment, if a country electorate is being badly served byETSA, it can bring direct political pressure to bear on Government throughits local member for changes to address the problems. Once the ultimatedecisions about pricing are moved from Adelaide to Canberra or Sydney orMelbourne, then the accountability that we now have will be totally lost.<p>More in sorrow than in anger, I say to the Independent Member forMacKillop, the Government cannot deliver on the promises it has made aboutcountry pricing. In the wake of privatisation, the city/country electricityprice differential may not occur immediately, but it will occur. If ETSAand Optima become privately owned companies, then it is an odds-on bet thatthe level of price increases imposed on country electricity users will behigher than if the companies remain in public ownership.<p>In short, in an environment of rising electricity prices, there isabsolutely no inherent advantage to the South Australian taxpayer inselling ETSA and Optima assets. <p>But what of an environment in which electricity prices are falling, over time?<p>The Premier has said on more than one occasion that electricity prices willfall in a national market and that this will result in lower prices toconsumers. This might be the case if ETSA and Optima continue to bepublicly owned. <p>But if the companies are in the hands of private owners and operators,there is little likelihood of falling average national prices beingreflected in falling prices for smaller consumers. As average electricityprices fall, the managers and operators of privatised ETSA and Optimacompanies would be under great pressure from their shareholders to keepelectricity prices to South Australian consumers at levels above averagenational market prices in order to maximise returns on the capital investedin the companies. <p>We are told that this will be prevented by the appointment of anIndependent Economic Regulator. What I say to the Government is just who isthis regulator to be independent of? Certainly not the electricityindustry, because it will be paying his or her salary. <p>The mechanism by which it is proposed that prices are to be set is entirelybureaucratic and opaque. Only industry insiders and the regulatorybureaucrats will know what is going on. And when Government Ministers,bureaucrats and industry participants get together and tell us that aproposed pricing arrangement is in the best interests of consumers, I reachfor my gun. And I load both barrels with buckshot when State GovernmentMinisters announce that they intend to opt out of their existingaccountability to South Australian voters by handing ultimate control ofpricing of a basic service like electricity to Federal Government bureaucrats<p>In short, I am convinced that if ETSA and Optima are sold into privatehands, South Australian consumers and taxpayers will be no better off, andare more likely to be worse off, no matter in which direction electricityprices move in the future.<p>There is every prospect that the proposed bureaucratic regulators of thenational electricity market will ensure that competition is sufficientlylimited to guarantee the owners of the assets a return on their investmentin the assets. As my colleague, the Independent Member for Gordon notedrecently, this much has been made clear by Investra, one of the potentialbidders for the distribution network assets, the ‘poles and wires' side ofthe business: "...under the National Access Code, regulators are requiredto allow reasonable returns to owners and operators of the distributionnetworks..."<p>What constitutes a "reasonable" return to the owners and operators of theelectricity assets is, of course, all in the eye of the beholder, but I amabsolutely certain that Investra's idea of what constitutes a reasonablerate of return is significantly higher than any country consumer wouldagree was reasonable. And it doesn't take a financial genius to work outwho the regulator is likely to side with when pricing decisions are in thebalance. The industry is going to be paying the regulator, after all. <p>Any suggestion that risk is something new and something that apublicly-owned electricity company could not manage is utter nonsense.Market risk can be and is mitigated in the normal course of businessoperations by the use of safeguards and appropriate risk management systemsby the companies. For example, effective use of hedging contracts enteredinto by ETSA to manage its exposure to Pool price variations has andundoubtedly will continue to minimise the effect of Pool price variationson its operating profit. <p>Another risk myth which doesn't hold up under any sort of factual scrutinyis the myth that South Australia must sell ETSA and Optima in order to meetits National Competition Policy obligations to gain access to "CompetitionPolicy" payments of some $320 million and associated Federal GovernmentFinancial Assistance Grants.<p>The Government is doing its best to convince South Australians that sellingETSA and Optima is necessary to meet its commitments under the CompetitionPolicy Agreement. The long and the short of this argument is that thecommitments can be met with ETSA remaining in public ownership. All that isrequired is the effective restructuring through disaggregation of theoperating entities, precisely along the lines that the Government is nowproposing. But it is not a requirement that the assets also be sold off.<p>So it all comes down to State debt management and regaining control of thebudget. <p>The Premier has raised the spectre of a continuing and inexorably risingState debt burden if ETSA and Optima are not sold. The alternative to asale is said to be tax increases and/or spending cuts. This line ofargument is supported by various advisors and bureaucrats. Most of them arefinancial carpetbaggers who are here because there is an opportunity tomake a quick buck out of South Australia's financial difficulties. Theyhave a large financial stake in the sale proceeding, and I dismiss theirclaims for the benefits of a sale as entirely self-interested. However,some entirely respectable commentators who undoubtedly have SouthAustralia's interests at heart have also come out in support of the sale.<p>If there was a net benefit to South Australia from the sale of ETSA andOptima of sufficient magnitude to cut State debt to a point where publicsector finances were turned around, then the argument being put by peoplelike Professor Cliff Walsh would be hard to resist. An opportunity tosubstantially cut or eliminate our net interest obligations currently at$728 million is, on its face, both attractive and responsible to the pointof being hard to argue against.<p>Unfortunately, on the information I have received, the net debt retirementresulting from even the most optimistic sale price estimates do not equateto anywhere near the much publicised $2 million per day interest savings.In a briefing with Government advisors Morgan Stanley last evening, I wasadvised that many ongoing liabilities and obligations of ETSA and Optimaare likely to be isolated and quite possibly remain with the State as aGovernment Entity debt. <p>The details of this shuffling of debt on the books to bolster the saleprice are yet to be finalised. What risk will be retained by the Governmentand at what cost is also yet to be calculated. What impact this will haveon the budget bottom line is fuzzy, at best.<p>Compare this unknown and unquantifiable reduction in the liability to thedividend of $193 million that ETSA will pay to the Government this year andit becomes obvious that the net benefit to South Australia of selling theassets is unlikely, in any sale price scenario, be to more than $150million per year.<p>The reality is that we are going to have tax increases and spending cuts,or both, whether or not ETSA and Optima are sold. This is the hard truththat the Premier and the Treasurer won't admit to.<p>And of course, if ETSA and Optima were sold to achieve a small reduction inthe State debt level and annual interest bill, the burden of the debt isonly being shoved around the State financial balance sheet. The burden ofthe debt will simply be transferred from the government sector to SouthAustralian electricity consumers. It may look like good politics to theGovernment, but it is an unacceptable abrogation of its financial andbudget responsibility.<p>In speaking about this sale proposal on an earlier occasion, I said that,to achieve a selling price which reflects anything like the truecapitalised value of the ETSA and Optima assets, the Government wouldeither have to allow a purchaser to increase electricity pricessubstantially, or underwrite the new owner's profits. <p>In studying the bill now before Parliament, it is apparent to me that theGovernment has reached the same conclusion. The bill includes provisionswhich give the Government enough flexibility to offer the kind ofguarantees that effectively underwrite the future profitability of newowners of ETSA and Optima assets. <p>I would like to touch briefly on some other relevant issues in our reviewof this bill. In the first instance, the National Party in South Australiatakes the view that this State's publicly owned electricity transmissionand distribution assets, and at least part of the State's generationbusinesses, are natural monopolies. We will not consider or support thesale of such assets unless and until all the regulatory and marketcontestability issues associated with their private ownership and operationare acknowledged by the Government, fully aired and satisfactorily resolved.<p>Second, we say that the sale of ETSA and Optima assets is not apre-condition or requirement for South Australia's compliance with nationalCompetition Policy. This has been acknowledged by Professor Hilmer andvarious others involved in implementing the competition reforms agreed toin 1995. <p>Third, we are concerned that it is still totally unclear how the NationalElectricity Market is to operate in practice. The break-up and sale ofpreviously integrated electricity enterprises in other States has putconsiderable pressure on the achievement and maintenance of economies ofscale in the industry. It is also unclear whether separation of theindustry into generation, transmission and distribution, and retailbusinesses will be a viable option in a business sense, over the longer term.<p>Fourth, and let me acknowledge that the Member for Gordon has alreadyclearly pointed to the significance of this issue, the future ownership andoperation of our public electricity assets must be considered and debatedin the context of an overall energy policy- a State energy vision- and thenow unavoidable obligations and changes in our energy usage options whichflow from the Federal Government's recent decision to sign up to the KyotoProtocol and Climate change conventions.<p>I now turn to some aspects of the bill itself. Part 3 deals withrestructuring and disposal. The provisions of the bill under Part 3 areextraordinarily wide. Accountability or limitations on the power of thegovernment are noticeably absent. The Government seeks authorisation inthis bill to do pretty much as it sees fit in its efforts to sell ETSA andOptima. And the bill proposes that the Minister be able to exercise thisextraordinary power without any reference to Parliament. <p>Specifically, Clauses 8 and 9 of the bill proposes that the Minister beallowed to take control of and transfer or re-transfer any part or all ofthe assets of ETSA and Optima, prospectively or retrospectively, withoutbeing subject to any other law, on such conditions as the Minister thinksfit . <p>Under clause 10, the Minister is to be empowered by this legislation to fixthe conditions on which such a transfer or re-transfer takes place. Theseconditions can include the assigning of any value to assets and liabilitiesthat the Minister thinks fit. <p>Clause 11 proposes to give the Minister the power to transfer ETSA andOptima assets to a purchaser, grant leases in respect of the assets,virtually without restriction and again, without any reference to thisParliament. <p>Clause 12 is of particular interest. It provides that the Treasurer maydeclare by order in writing that specified transferred liabilities are tocontinue to be guaranteed by the Government, as if the transferee were apublic corporation. <p>A major objective of a sale is said to be the reduction of existing risksto the taxpayer of exposure to ETSA and Optima liabilities. The Governmentguarantee is said to be one such risk that will be eliminated throughprivatisation. If this is so, Mr Speaker, why does the Treasurer seekthrough clause 12 the flexibility to be able to re-commit the Government toguaranteeing the liabilities of a private company or companies that maypurchase ETSA and Optima assets? The obvious answer is that the Governmentintends to have enough flexibility in the sale legislation to giveguarantees that effectively underwrite the future profitability of a newowner of ETSA and Optima. <p>It is one thing for a potential purchaser of a public business or asset toknow or hope that there exists an implied guarantee by the State in respectof that business, especially if it involves the provision of an essentialservice, It is, however, another thing altogether for the Government togive an explicit guarantee in these circumstances. <p>Clause 15 creates another area of doubt about the Government's motives inrespect of the proceeds of this sale. It provides for the treasurer toapply proceeds of a sale or lease to the discharge of ETSA and Optimaliabilities, which is appropriate; to the retirement of State debt, whichis also appropriate; and in payment to the Consolidated Account. There isno doubt that the Government would like to use at least some part, andperhaps a substantial part, of the proceeds of the sale of these and otherState assets on recurrent programs.<p>This provision to use sale proceeds on recurrent spending has been includednotwithstanding the commitment given personally to me by the Premier at ameeting he called in Berri on the 10th March. In response to a questionfrom me the Premier gave an unequivocal guarantee that all the proceedsfrom any sale of ETSA and Optima would be used to retire State debt.<p>The Premier then changed his position in a Ministerial Statement on 26 May1998, and I quote "... After this two-year period, the moneys from the saleof the State's power companies will become available. A we have alreadystated publicly, whilst most of this money will be used to retire debt, aportion will be used to further finance targeted needs such as whateveremployment programs are required."<p>Surprise, surprise! the Premier's position changed again in the full pageadvertisement in recent rural newspapers-where we're told again that allproceeds will be used to retire State debt.<p>One really can't help but be suspicious of what will really happen so longas the provision in clause 15 that specifically enables payment of proceedsto the Consolidated Account remains in the Bill.<p>A loss of budgetary focus and the easing of necessary spending restraintis, in my view, emerging as an important factor in the apparent failure ofthe Government to continue to make inroads into our massive State debtoverhang. Our existing debt level is the economic problem threatening ourfuture. It is, therefore, totally unacceptable for the Government tocontemplate using any part of ETSA and Optima sale proceeds for any purposeother than State debt reduction. <p>The budgetary difficulty we now face is almost entirely attributable atfirst instance to the appalling financial mismanagement of this State byLabor Governments. Labor does not deserve and must not be given theopportunity to again reduce the South Australian economy to a financialwasteland. But we have had almost 5 years of Liberal Government duringwhich financial rehabilitation has been disappointingly slow and timid. <p>It is certainly a time for hard financial decisions by the Government, buthow can South Australians, and in particular, country people, take theeffort and the future intentions of this Government seriously when itoffers such little resistance to outrageous public sector wage demands inkey areas such as health, education and police. <p>In my view, the effect of recent and proposed public sector wage increasesis a factor that will prove just as important in exporting jobs to otherStates as our burgeoning State debt interest payments.<p>The effect has been to create two economies in South Australia-thewell-insulated, well paid, taxpayer-financed public sector economy, and therest of South Australia. It is a recipe for social division and it will notbe cured by the sale of our strategic assets to cover the budget blow-outthat the Government lacks the courage to control.<br clear=all><p><center><img src="http://www.electric.on.net/ads/ads_news/agriffiths_optometrist.gif" width=380 height=60 border=0></center><p><center><hr noshade><A HREF="http://www.electric.on.net"        onMouseOver="waxon('home');        statuson('home'); return true;"        onMouseOut="statusoff(); waxoff('home');        return true;"><IMG name=home SRC="../buttons/butt_home_off.gif" ALT="home" WIDTH="140" HEIGHT="32" BORDER="0"></a><A HREF="../essays/index.html"        onMouseOver="waxon('essays');        statuson('essays'); return true;"        onMouseOut="statusoff(); waxoff('essays');        return true;"><IMG name=essays SRC="../buttons/butt_essays_off.gif" ALT="essays" WIDTH="140" HEIGHT="32" BORDER="0"></a><hr noshade></center><p><A HREF="http://www.electric.on.net">http://www.electric.on.net</A><p>&copy; This work is subject to copyright.
