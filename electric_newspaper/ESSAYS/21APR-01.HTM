He smiled alot. He wore large spectacles and looked like a Kid's Show host. Hereminded some of us of our old household friend, Mr. Sheen. He seemedbenign and reasonable.<p>Then, Pete did all that great TV with Saint Cheryl. He beamed as theydeclared Industrial "Peace in our time". This was his triumph. HisIndustrial Relations Bill .The sky seemed the limit. Pete was PM material,or so it seemed.<p>Years before, a very much less endearing Pete walked amongst us. He was thethen Opposition's Terminator. He displayed breathtaking rudeness wheninterviewed. He talked over his opponents. He almost foamed at the mouthsaying foolish, intellectually dishonest things about referenda proposed bythe then Government. He was like an opposition mad dog, unleashed onsensitive political targets.<p>When the new warm and fuzzy Pete was wheeled out on to the tarmac for thefirst time in 1996, those with a memory of the old Pete smelt a rat. <p>Perhaps Pete had an evil alter-ego, a "Mr. Hyde". Perhaps this alter egohad suppressed the warm lovable man locked inside him for all those years.<p>Perhaps just before the 1996 election, exhausted on a diet of conflict,this evil alter-ego had vanished, allowing the warm, lovable Pete out again.<p> Well, if the last few weeks are any indication, its no more Mr. Nice Guy.The "Mr. Hyde" is back in charge.<p>Pete's problem is that he did some things during his warm and fuzzy phasewhich may come back to haunt him. Worst of all, he proudly sponsoredlegislation making it illegal to terminate a person's employment becausethey are in a Union.  <p>In the last year or so, the Government has made numerous attempts to induceindividuals and companies to pick a fight with the MUA. Now the fight hasstarted, with the dirty work being done by proxy on the Government's behalf. <p>The Government is giving encouragement and promises of financial support toprovoke an escalation of the conflict. The strategy is classic Reith. Stirthe protagonists up to a point where the ACTU or the MUA does somethingstupid, then hit them with every weapon in the legal arsenal.<p>Never mind that Pete's proxy had to use elaborate legal arrangements toattempt to keep clear of Pete's own law protecting Unionists. According toPete, it is the Union that is acting unlawfully. This is a bit like afirebug who lights a bushfire and then joins in attempts to put out theblaze. The difference is that in this case Pete is still urging more fuelto be thrown on the flames.<p>A Government should be trying to sort this out, not provoking more outrage.<p>Perhaps Pete has a strategy that links this dispute and his ambition tobeat that other well known  Pete  to the Lodge. Perhaps the strategy islike this:<p>Stir up a dispute on the waterfront-escalate it .Goad the ACTU into action which can be portrayed as radical and dangerousGoad the ALP into the ever -widening vortex of conflict.Give John Howard an election issue - a scare campaign about Union power-goto the polls, 1960's style.Wait for John Howard to win an historic victory - claim to be the principalarchitect of victory.Stake a claim on the top job as a reward for services rendered.Manipulate a stab in the back for John Howard - hopefully appearing to comefrom the Costello Camp.Cry crocodile tears for the fallen leader, then step over Costello and intothe Lodge.<p>This dispute is now entering a very unpredictable phase. Pete is playingfor high stakes. The MUA has a lot riding on the outcome. The MUA will notgo quietly like a lamb to the slaughter. If this goes terribly wrong, Petemay wind up finishing himself off in the process .<p>The PM has a responsibility to acknowledge the tainted conduct of Pete'sproxy and to ensure that the law is honoured, on all sides.   <p><center><hr noshade><A HREF="http://www.electric.on.net"        onMouseOver="waxon('home');        statuson('home'); return true;"        onMouseOut="statusoff(); waxoff('home');        return true;"><IMG name=home SRC="../buttons/butt_home_off.gif" ALT="home" WIDTH="140" HEIGHT="32" BORDER="0"></a><A HREF="../essays/index.html"        onMouseOver="waxon('essays');        statuson('essays'); return true;"        onMouseOut="statusoff(); waxoff('essays');        return true;"><IMG name=essays SRC="../buttons/butt_essays_off.gif" ALT="essays" WIDTH="140" HEIGHT="32" BORDER="0"></a><hr noshade></center><p><A HREF="http://www.electric.on.net">http://www.electric.on.net</A><p>&copy; This work is subject to copyright.
