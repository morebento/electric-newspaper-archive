Federal Budget delivers good news</font></B><br><font size=-1>by Legh Davis, Liberal Member in the Legislative Council</font><p>It is not easy to read good news these days .  The reporting of good newsis distinctly unfashionable.  Why should people be entitled to know goodnews, when there is so much misery in the world?  The old adage fortelevision news, which is practised religiously by commercial stations, is"If it bleeds, it leads".  <p>Therefore it may have been disturbing to some people to see that theFederal Budget delivered by Treasurer Peter Costello, actually containedsome good news.  The underlying budget surplus was $2.7 billion, which is adramatic turnaround from the $10.3 billion deficit which the Liberal Partyinherited from the Keating Labor Government.  You might remember for a longtime Labor was adamant that there was no such black hole, although inrecent days Shadow Treasurer, Gareth Evans, has overcome his earlierAlzheimer's attack and admitted there was indeed a black hole of our ownmaking.  <p>Gross domestic product (GDP) will increase in 1998/99 by 3%, having beenshaved by 0.75% to reflect the Asian financial crisis.  Unemployment ispredicted to fall to 7.75%.  <p>The rate of inflation is expected to edge up to 2.5%, reflecting theinflationary impact of the weakening Australian dollar and the increase inimports and import prices.  <p>Over the next three years the Government plans to slash the Commonwealthdebt by two thirds as a result of asset sales.  <p>Even Paul Keating would be forced to admit this was "a beautiful set ofnumbers".  However, the real challenge for the Howard Government is taxreform.  The Fraser Government of the late 1970's squibbed the opportunityof introducing a goods and services tax (GST), even though it had controlof the Senate - the last Federal Government to do so.  The HawkeGovernment's tax summit flirted with a Keating-driven GST proposal, butbacked off under pressure.  In 1991 Liberal Leader, John Hewson's Fightbackpackage won over the voters for a period of time until it was savaged byPaul Keating following his elevation to the Prime Ministership.  <p>So 1998 will be fourth time lucky for major tax reform.  <p>The facts are compelling.  Average earnings in Australia are now $39,000per annum. But the income tax rate is 43 cents in the dollar for over$38,000 in earnings and 34 cents in the dollar for between $20,700 and$38,000.  These are extraordinarily high and punitive marginal rates foraverage income earners.  6.2 million of the 8.2 million taxpayers inAustralia (75.6%) earn between $5,000 and $38,000.  Obviously the mainbenefits from any tax cuts should flow to people in these income brackets.<p>The optimistic outlook for the Australian economy over the next 12 monthsis encouraging, particularly in view of the fact that Australia incomparative terms has a greater trade exposure to Asia than any othercountry.  <p>The major wild card in this otherwise promising economic future isunexpected economic and/or financial dislocation in Asia.  Japan, whichaccounts for 20% of our exports, has at best a flat economy and perhapscould be entering into a period of recession, which reflects the internalstructural problems which have remained unaddressed over the last 5 years.The forecast for the Indonesian economy is grim, with an 8% decline in GDPexpected in 1998.  South Korea is also forecast to slump, with a 4% fall inGDP in the current year.  On the other hand, China has emerged as thefinancial leader in Asia, holding its currency firm in the face of sharplydepreciating currencies elsewhere.  Its highly focused leadership isdetermined to drive the transition from a communist state with inefficientand bureaucratic government-owned instrumentalities, to a market economy.Economic growth is forecast to be in the order of 8% in the current year.Taiwan, up 5.5% and Hong Kong, with a 3% increase predicted, are alsoperforming well despite regional uncertainty.  <p>It is interesting to reflect that during the 1980's and 1990's (except forthe last 8 months) Australia has piggy-backed on annual Asian economicgrowth in the order of 8-10%.  The basic strength and stability of theAustralian economy is underlined by the fact our economic outlook is stillexcellent, notwithstanding the damaging impact of Asia.  Now that's what Icall really good news! <p><center><hr noshade><A HREF="http://www.electric.on.net"        onMouseOver="waxon('home');        statuson('home'); return true;"        onMouseOut="statusoff(); waxoff('home');        return true;"><IMG name=home SRC="../buttons/butt_home_off.gif" ALT="home" WIDTH="140" HEIGHT="32" BORDER="0"></a><A HREF="../essays/index.html"        onMouseOver="waxon('essays');        statuson('essays'); return true;"        onMouseOut="statusoff(); waxoff('essays');        return true;"><IMG name=essays SRC="../buttons/butt_essays_off.gif" ALT="essays" WIDTH="140" HEIGHT="32" BORDER="0"></a><hr noshade></center><p><A HREF="http://www.electric.on.net">http://www.electric.on.net</A><p>&copy; This work is subject to copyright.
