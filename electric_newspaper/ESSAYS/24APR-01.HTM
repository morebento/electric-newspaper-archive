Thedictionary definition of "obligation" is "a moral or legal duty, orindebtedness for a service or favour".  In law school students are taughtthat for every right there is a corresponding obligation.  But while themedia is full of stories of rights being taken away or denied, there isvery little about that unfashionable word "obligation".<p>Let's take the example of smoking.  There have been recent cases in theUnited States where individuals have taken action against tobacco companieson the grounds that smoking has been injurious to their health.  That maynot surprise the intelligent readers of The Electric Newspaper, but if thisproposition is carried through to its logical conclusion, no-one isresponsible for anything.  The warnings about the link between smoking andcancer have been around for decades.  But some of the people suing comefrom a generation who would have been heavily exposed to publicity aboutthe dangers of smoking.<p>Closer to home, there is currently a debate raging about the evils ofgambling and in particular the social and economic impact of pokermachines.  It should be emphasised that poker machine legislation was aproduct of the Bannon Labor Government which was desperate to raise revenuefrom anywhere and anyone following the State Bank and SGIC debacles.  It isa matter of record that in the House of Assembly the poker machinelegislation passed narrowly.  Of the 21 votes in favour, 17 were cast byLabor Party Members.<p>In the Legislative Council the legislation was passed by the barest ofmargins and only because Premier Bannon spent the very early hours of onemorning talking to a Labor Party Member under a rather bright light!  Ivoted against the poker machine legislation, as did the majority of myLiberal Party colleagues, because I did not like the model proposed and Iwas uneasy about the social and economic consequences.  <p>Although there is now widespread public concern about poker machines, itshould be remembered that gambling takes many forms.  There are people whomay be hooked on blackjack or the roulette wheel at the Casino.  The racingcodes (horse racing, trotting and greyhounds) while providing significantemployment in South Australia, also inevitably play host to chronicgamblers.  Hundreds of people have ruined their lives and those of theirloved ones by excessive gambling.<p>And the hospitality industry through hotels and clubs obviously has cateredfor a large number of alcoholics.  Drinking has the added dimension that itnot only causes financial ruin and human misery, but also death throughdrink driving.  <p>And in leisure, Victoria experienced a spate of drownings in the recentsummer months, almost all due to the fact that swimmers flaunted the safetyflags and swam in unpatrolled areas.  <p>There have been horrific examples over recent years of parents partying allnight or being absent during the day and leaving young children at homealone to fend for themselves.  <p>Perhaps of lesser consequence but still relevant to the argument is theirresponsibility of people who leave broken glass on a beach, litter thepavement with rubbish, or desecrate or vandalise public or private property.  <p>The vast majority of the community could plead not guilty to any of theabove.  But the social and economic costs of people flaunting their rightsand privileges while ignoring their obligations are enormous.  <p>There is also a growing tendency to blame governments for anything andeverything that goes wrong.  Individuals or the community at largeincreasingly expect governments to find solutions to social or economicproblems not of the government's making.  In some cases these problems mayhave been avoided or solved if individuals had a clearer recognition oftheir obligations.  <p>It would be nice to think the big O word might enjoy an increase inpopularity as we scramble towards the millennium.  But perhaps I am justold fashioned!<p><center><hr noshade><A HREF="http://www.electric.on.net"        onMouseOver="waxon('home');        statuson('home'); return true;"        onMouseOut="statusoff(); waxoff('home');        return true;"><IMG name=home SRC="../buttons/butt_home_off.gif" ALT="home" WIDTH="140" HEIGHT="32" BORDER="0"></a><A HREF="../essays/index.html"        onMouseOver="waxon('essays');        statuson('essays'); return true;"        onMouseOut="statusoff(); waxoff('essays');        return true;"><IMG name=essays SRC="../buttons/butt_essays_off.gif" ALT="essays" WIDTH="140" HEIGHT="32" BORDER="0"></a><hr noshade></center><p><A HREF="http://www.electric.on.net">http://www.electric.on.net</A><p>&copy; This work is subject to copyright.
