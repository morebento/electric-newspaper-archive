Note that dollars are 1997 dollars.  Note alsothat the job figures relate to direct production only.Predicted:<p><pre>Production by 1993		150 000  tonnes per annumDirect (I say direct) jobs	2268 to 2815Annual value of production	$1,200 millionAnnual royalties		$50 million</pre><p>These figures were taken from the Environmental Impact Statement (EIS)produced for the joint venturers.  I didn't invent them, nor did I modify,obscure or shuffle them. These sorts of figures were central to the campaign to establish the mine.In the end, the issues of waste disposal and nuclear weapons proliferation,and the dodgy environmental record of past uranium mining operations weresecondary to the lure of thousands upon thousands of jobs, and millionsupon millions of dollars for us lucky South Australians.<p>So what was achieved by 1997?  The outcomes were:<p><pre>	Production by 1993		85,000  tonnes per annum	Direct (yes, direct) jobs	946	Annual value of production	$350 million	Annual royalties		$9.5 million</pre><p>To compare jobs figures including construction and multiplier effects withdirect production jobs forecasts is to misrepresent the facts, as iscomparing dollar amounts across a span of years without allowing forchanges in value of the dollar over that time. <p>Since the economic aspects of the project were considered the mostimportant, it would seem doubly unsatisfactory that the reality had fallenso far short of the predictions.<p>A lot was  made of the importance of this project to the economy of SA, infact, reading the Advertiser, back in 1982, one could be led to believethat the state's whole future existence depended on it.<p><CENTER><IMG SRC="http://www.electric.on.net/essays/29June/1982.jpg" WIDTH="538" HEIGHT="391" BORDER="0" HSPACE="3" VSPACE="3"></CENTER><p>"$40m. (pa) in royalties likely" shouted the front page headline of theAdvertiser  at the time.  Job estimates of variously 7500, 10,000 11,250and even 15,000 and so on were made so often as to become a sort of pseudofact.  Full page advertisements paid for by the Chamber of Commerceappeared almost daily, claiming  "Build Roxby Downs or the sign of the times will be ... NO WORK".<p>Mr Davis's response (Electric Newspaper, June 5 1998) was thunderous andcontained a plethora of large numbers.  By describing my article as"ideological claptrap", and then presenting a series of "facts", hepresumably thought that a wrong had been righted, and truth restored.  Thefacts I presented were perfectly correct of course, but in rushing to stompout any alternative points of view he missed the point, that being thatmajor and important decisions affecting the state and its citizens, must bemade in an environment of informed debate, with an informed electorate.Indeed, good democracy requires an informed electorate, not a misled one.<p>Democracy also relies on the exercise of due process.  Environmental ImpactStatements serve to shed light on the nature of an intended development.The draft EIS is published so that the public can be informed, and gives anopportunity for the public to present submissions that seek clarificationor modification or even outright opposition.  When an EIS such as the oneprepared for the Roxby Downs development has been shown to be so wrong, onecould be forgiven for losing a little faith in that process.<p>A further example of illusion versus reality involves the EIS prediction ofachieving full output from the mine in five years.   Mr Davis suggests thatI might expect the mine to reach its projected output "from day one".Well, one day is a bit short, but since the mine began operation in 1988,I would have thought that nine years (about 3,300 days) would have beenadequate, particularly when the DEIS of 1982 actually predicted full outputby 1993.<p>Mr Davis also misses the point when he suggests that I "lament" the factthat the value of production reached only $350m.  What I lament is the factthat such an inaccurate set of predictions could be put forward as a basisupon which to make rational decisions on such a contentious matter, andthat our parliament lacked the capacity to critically assess these claims.<p>Of course, Western Mining Corporation, (WMC) being the ideal corporatecitizen, it naturally is greatly concerned about the public's perception ofits environmental credentials.  For that reason, it is a contributor toAMEEF, the mining industry's environmental PR foundation.  That such a bodywould bestow an environmental award on the town of Roxby Downs, a WMC town,should come as no surprise to anyone.<p>Giving itself awards might impress some folk, but I was less than impressedwhen WMC announced in 1994 that 5 million cubic metres of liquid had leakedfrom its tailings dam over the previous years.  I was also less thanimpressed to learn that the tailings storage facility described in the EIShad been substantially modified without any public consultation.  Onewonders why bother with the EIS in the first place.  After all, our leadersknow best.  The whereabouts of the escaped waste is not known,notwithstanding the "enormous amount of  environmental knowledge of  aridAustralia" possessed by WMC.  Radioactive wastes have half lives of tens,hundreds or even thousands of years.  A mine operating for less than tenyears is already having trouble containing that waste, one wonders at howsuch long lived wastes will be successfully managed for generations to come.<p>The Draft EIS's for the proposed Honeymoon and Beverley In Situ Leachuranium mines are due to be published shortly.  Given the somewhatextravagant claims made in the Roxby EIS, and the way in which it was inpart ignored after the event, these DEIS's must be scrutinised thoroughly,the public kept informed, and due process followed.   <p>Lest you think that information, debate and scrutiny lie exclusively in thedomain of the uranium mining sector, even as I write, the battle for thehearts and minds of the public begins on another contentious and importantdecision, the selling of ETSA.  For all the shouting, precious little inthe way of fact, reason and light is being directed our way.<p>Irrespective of the issue, the better decision will inevitably be made ifthe maximum number of people are adequately and correctly informed. <br clear=all><p><center><img src="http://www.electric.on.net/ads/ads_news/agriffiths_optometrist.gif" width=380 height=60 border=0></center><p><center><hr noshade><A HREF="http://www.electric.on.net"        onMouseOver="waxon('home');        statuson('home'); return true;"        onMouseOut="statusoff(); waxoff('home');        return true;"><IMG name=home SRC="../buttons/butt_home_off.gif" ALT="home" WIDTH="140" HEIGHT="32" BORDER="0"></a><A HREF="../essays/index.html"        onMouseOver="waxon('essays');        statuson('essays'); return true;"        onMouseOut="statusoff(); waxoff('essays');        return true;"><IMG name=essays SRC="../buttons/butt_essays_off.gif" ALT="essays" WIDTH="140" HEIGHT="32" BORDER="0"></a><hr noshade></center><p><A HREF="http://www.electric.on.net">http://www.electric.on.net</A><p>&copy; This work is subject to copyright.
