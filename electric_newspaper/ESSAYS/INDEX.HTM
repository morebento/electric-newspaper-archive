The reporting of good newsis distinctly unfashionable.  Why should people be entitled to know goodnews, when there is so much misery in the world?  The old adage fortelevision news, which is practised religiously by commercial stations, is"If it bleeds, it leads".  <p align=right><font size=-1><A HREF="15May-01.html">would you like to know more?</a></font><BR clear=all><p><hr noshade><p><img src="dinkus/john_spoehr.jpg" width=70 height=90 align=right vspace=3 hspace=3><B><font size=+2><A HREF="14May-01.html">Surplus to requirements: more jobs go</a></font></B><br><font size=-1>by John Spoehr</font><p>The $2.7 billion Budget surplus has been achieved at the expense ofsignificant reductions in Commonwealth General Government outlays andgrants to the States.
