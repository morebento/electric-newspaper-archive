As anewly-elected MLC in last October's State election and the firstItalian-born woman to be elected to the Legislative Council, I guess it isnatural for me to have strong views concerning the current race andmulticulturalism debate.<p>The title of my article is not just designed to attract attention - it isin fact a paraphrase of a headline from the 13 July edition of Il Globo,Australia's largest foreign language newspaper.  The title of the articlewas 'One Nation party and a certain mafia mentality' and it suggested thatstudents of internal Italian and Australian politics might be struck by thecoincidences and similarities of the ideas and tactics of the Italian LegaNord and the Australian One Nation Party.  Il Globo suggested that bothmovements have grown on a mixture of populism, racism, and a widespreadmalaise of democracies which goes under the generic term of intolerance.<p>The latest article from Il Globo is representative of the consistentlystrong stance they have taken against Hanson and One Nation.  Previousheadlines have included "Queensland election: a triumph for racists", "Frombanana republic to the kingdom of the Ku Klux Klan", "One Nation danger:the coalition trembles", "Too little too late from Howard in the struggleagainst racism in Australia".  Whilst I am only familiar in some detailwith the Italian ethnic media, at least this normally conservative ethnicnewspaper has taken the Hanson factor much more seriously than the rest ofAustralia's popular press.  As I have jokingly suggested, groups are beingsingled out by One Nation in alphabetical order - Aborigines and Asianstoday, Greeks and Italians tomorrow? <p>In Adelaide this week were two women of widely disparate backgrounds, with themedia paying special attention to only one of them, One Nation'sParliamentary Leader.  It is not exactly difficult for Hanson and her Partyto get publicity.  Hanson's latest gaffe (she should stick to her script)concerns the apparent folly of the Australian people in 1967, inoverwhelmingly supporting a referendum to count Aborigines in the censusand to give the Federal government power to make laws for the benefit ofour indigenous Australians, and not to give them the vote as she falselyclaimed.  <p>The other person in Adelaide who did receive some media, mostly via ABCradio, was Dr Mary Kalantzis, who was here as a guest speaker for theHellenic Conference - a conference held to debate issues of importance tothe Hellenic-Australian community.  It is the first time that I have heardin a public forum such strong criticism concerning the manner in whichpolitical parties and in particular the Liberal Party and John Howard, thePrime Minister, have handled the Hanson issue.  <p>Steve Condous looked a bit uncomfortable, even though he had criticised thePrime Minister himself in the South Australian Parliament.  Dr Kalantzisbelieves not enough has been said by the major parties because we are allrunning scared.  As a Member of the Party that gave migrants in SouthAustralia a sense of belonging and a sense of diversity through the conceptof multiculturalism, I took some exception to that particular comment.  <p>Whilst in South Australia we have strong bi-partisan support formulticulturalism, people are nonetheless fed by the popular press a dailymenu of what at best can only be described as sensationalism - the womanwho was taken as a joke has turned the joke on Australia's vulnerable:  ourindigenous population, migrants, single mums, to name but a few.<p>Hansonism has been called the politics of grievance.  It was the excusegiven by Liberal politicians in particular in relation to the manner inwhich semi-rural Queensland voted in that State election. The bush may behurting but so are many other people in our community.  The overwhelmingmajority of people who have migrated to Australia have worked hard andenriched this nation.  During difficult economic and rapidly changingtimes, pointing the finger at people who are not breaking any laws, but wholook different, speak differently or behave differently - is not onlymisguided but is also dangerous as history shows. <p>The important question that needs to be asked is 'who has given One Nationrespectability?'  I guess there is only one answer to that - the manythousands of people who have supported Hanson and to some extent thepopular media.  <p>In my Maiden Speech last year, I said that I believed that the concept ofmulticulturalism and the post-war migration program have been Australia'sgreat success stories, and asked why were they suddenly under threat?  Iwent on to say that all of us would accept that most individuals and ethnicgroups are to some extent prejudiced against others and that it hasprobably been the cause of many wars throughout history.  I believe howeverthat our 'Australian experiment' was unique because of the bipartisancommitment and support of both the migration program and the concept ofmulticulturalism over the last 25 years.<p>I called on the federal coalition Government and in particular the PrimeMinister to follow South Australia's lead in its support ofmulticulturalism and added, "We need a strong, clear, unequivocal statementfrom the Prime Minister as our national leader in full support of anon-discriminatory immigration program and the concept ofmulticulturalism," and further "There must also not be any equivocationabout Party preferences for any candidate who espouses racist views."<p>I am proud to say that my Party, the Australian Labor Party, did and willcontinue to stand on principle regarding preferences for Hanson and the OneNation Party.  If the coalition had had the courage and the decency to putOne Nation last in the Queensland election, the ALP would probably have wona few more seats and the end result would have been the same in terms offorming a government.  But the result for One Nation would have beendramatically different as they would have won only a couple of seats andtherefore would also likely have had only a minor impact on the comingfederal election. <p>Helen Sham-Ho's resignation from the Liberal Party seems to suggest thatthe sublime racism that one comes across from time to time is on theincrease.  It appears that Mrs Sham-Ho took her stand because ofsuggestions from some of her former colleagues that a person of Asianbackground standing as a candidate for the Presidency of the NSW UpperHouse might not be acceptable to One Nation supporters.  She also expressedher disappointment at the Prime Minister's lack of leadership concerningthe distribution of preferences by her former party.<p>What the One Nation phenomenon has done is bring the underlying subtleracism that exists in most communities to the fore, almost made itacceptable.  Subtle racism is in many ways a more insidious form of racismand often difficult to prove. <p>All Australians should be justly proud of both our Aboriginal and Europeanheritage, traditions, language and way of life - but I think there is roomfor people who have come to Australia to call this nation their home toalso be able to express their customs, traditions and languages, within thelaws of this nation, as well as to embrace those of their new home,Australia.<br clear=all><p><center><img src="http://www.electric.on.net/ads/ads_news/agriffiths_optometrist.gif" width=380 height=60 border=0></center><p><center><hr noshade><A HREF="http://www.electric.on.net"        onMouseOver="waxon('home');        statuson('home'); return true;"        onMouseOut="statusoff(); waxoff('home');        return true;"><IMG name=home SRC="../buttons/butt_home_off.gif" ALT="home" WIDTH="140" HEIGHT="32" BORDER="0"></a><A HREF="../essays/index.html"        onMouseOver="waxon('essays');        statuson('essays'); return true;"        onMouseOut="statusoff(); waxoff('essays');        return true;"><IMG name=essays SRC="../buttons/butt_essays_off.gif" ALT="essays" WIDTH="140" HEIGHT="32" BORDER="0"></a><hr noshade></center><p><A HREF="http://www.electric.on.net">http://www.electric.on.net</A><p>&copy; This work is subject to copyright.
