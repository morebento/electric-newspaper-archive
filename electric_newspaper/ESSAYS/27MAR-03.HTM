What is more, we are nottalking about a small iceberg, like the one which mortally damaged thetragic "Titanic", but one which threatens to sink entire economies.<p>Societies will increasingly discover that computer-related glitches area daily hazard. It may be easy to point fingers at electronic andsoftware engineers, but even the deepest of deep sea dives won't revealthe pertinent issues. <p>On the eve of the so-called "Millennium Bug", it is time for corporate andgovernmental executives and management at all other levels to put asidetheir greed, and embrace the need to understand the real cause.<p>Put simply, dubious design principles and poor management, are themajor impediments to better software outcomes. Similar things can besaid of the various hardware engineering forms. However, their relatedannoyances are generally much better understood.<p>What is not so well understood, if at all, is the special relationbetween software and hardware design in major projects, and especially,the particular issues unique to software development.<p>Some organisations, in various countries, have just begun to understandthe importance of "mature" software engineering processes. Many othershave not. It is quite common, if not the norm, for software developmentprojects to run over time, and, not surprisingly, over budget. This isextremely damaging: many jobs are either lost, or not created, due tothese budget blow outs.<p>It is certainly true that the imperative must be software that does whatit is intended to do, but a failure to use good design practices oftenleads to missed deadlines. Throwing money and time at a software projectthat is behind schedule, may achieve the designated result, but it doesnot solve the underlying problem.<p>Overhauling project management practices, to properly encompass thespecial requirements of good software development, is an excellentstart. Simultaneously, educational institutions must diligently preparefuture software engineers, so that they are able to perform their tasksusing a mature process.<p>With the increasing complexity of today's products comes the need tointroduce some aspects of computers, to those interested, at a muchearlier stage in their education.<p>One example of what has been happening in the U.S. may be of assistance.There, some software companies, in an effort to beat the competition tomarket, are content to ship faulty product. Deadlines are set, not bysoftware development teams, but by marketing personnel and management,and product is sent to be packaged before it is completed.<p>Fortunately, for some users, "patches" for said product are madeavailable on the Internet, and can be downloaded for "free". Consumerswithout access to the Internet are, of course, disadvantaged by suchinappropriate behaviour.<p>The resulting poor relations between users and the company are not theend of it. If the company loses market share, and needs to spend extramoney on customer support, the chances of it moving to a more matureprocess become less likely: a classic vicious circle .<p>One saving grace for the ASC, in its current predicament, is that it hasa monopoly. Clearly though, the certainty that came, from knowing a salewas inevitable, did not guarantee the best process.<p>For instance, the software systems required to operate the weaponssystem should have been completed much earlier; they should have been ahigher priority from the outset. The submarines cannot be handed overuntil their weapons system works, so the (completed) hardware is, atpresent, useless.<p>The hardware tests at sea are moot without a fully operational weaponssystem. Obviously, some sea trials are necessary, but the testcommanders would be learning much more if they had the option ofutilising (or not, as the case may be) all of the various softwaresystems. There is a limit to how much can be gleaned from testing thosesystems in isolation: the systems will, ultimately, have to coexist.<p>It was a commendable decision to try to create a new Australianindustry, arguments about relevance aside. However, the (apparent)mismanagement casts doubt on similar future commitments. Lessons must belearnt, and obviously will, but whether the big lesson is learnt willonly be known in time.<p>More immediately, the actions of management in overcoming today'scomputer date problems, such as year 2000 inaccuracies, should beclosely scrutinised by all. The "Millennium Bug" is not the onlycomputer date issue requiring attention. The use of "9/9/99" to indicate"Out of date", and the fact that 2000 is a leap year, are just two thatspring to mind; there are others.<p>All managers must take heed from the timely warning the ASC woesprovide. A review of software education in Australia is much moreimportant than the political scapegoating currently taking place. So,too, is better management of software as a whole. <p><hr noshade><p><A HREF="http://www.electric.on.net">http://www.electric.on.net</A><p>&copy; This work is subject to copyright.
