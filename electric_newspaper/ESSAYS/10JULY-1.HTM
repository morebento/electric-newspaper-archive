The rise of One Nation, biting a huge chunk out of theConservatives' primary vote, is enough to give any Liberal leaderheartburn. The prospect of a Wik double dissolution consummating thetransformation of Howard's battlers into Hanson's converts would havesharpened the pain deeply. The fact Howard nurtured the conditions thatencouraged the growth of One Nation must have had the Prime Ministertugging at his collar gasping for breath. <p>Make no mistake: Howard ploughed the ground, sowed the seeds and wateredthe field of the Wik dispute. He did so imagining that the Labor Partywould wither on the vine. It's proved a bitter harvest.<p>The Liberal's strategy on Wik has been lifted straight from the U.S.Republican's handbook on how to politically exploit racial animosity. TheRepublicans call it wedge politics.<p>Ironically the Republicans' strategy had its genesis in the successes ofthe civil rights movement in the sixties. In response to the appallinginequality exposed by the movement the Democrats sought legislativeremedies. In particular quotas were introduced for public sector jobs, theletting of public contracts and for admission to educational institutions.<p>The initial popular support for quotas waned as the costs became apparent.Those costs were borne predominantly by working class whites. It  was inthe low-skilled low-paid occupations where the quotas bit.<p>By the end of the sixties the Republicans noticed a strategy of oppositionto racially determined quotas was a potent political weapon. It drove awedge between two core constituencies of the Democrats, working classwhites and blacks hopeful of securing those jobs they were previouslyexcluded from. It is classic divide and conquer. It played on deep seatedprejudices.<p>The language of Republican wedge politics in the USA is temperate. "Racist"remains a pejorative term. Hence the end of quotas was about returningequality of opportunity no matter the colour or creed. Never mind thereality of life before quotas.<p>The strategy led to the creation of a voting block later known as Reagan'sDemocrats. The 1996 Federal election produced a remarkably similarphenomenon with a flood of traditional Labor voters crossing to theconservative parties. These voters even got a label - Howard's battlers.<p>The Keating Government's commitment to native title and reconciliation waswidely supported by the middle class left and much resented by many workingclass voters. Howard's Wik manoeuvres were designed to exploit thisdivision amongst Labor voters.<p>The issue in Australia is different, native title rather than quotas, butthe pitch is similar. John Howard talked of equality when he proposedpulling the teeth from native title rights. Howard knew that forcing theALP into opposing his position would continue to alienate many of itstraditional supporters.<p>On one level Howard's strategy has been reasonably successful. The ALP'sprimary vote has barely budged from its disastrous showing at the lastFederal election. The failure of the strategy is found in the plummetingCoalition vote. Howard's battlers have rejected both the Coalition and theALP and welcomed the new party of the right, One Nation.<p>Letting the racial genie out of the bottle wasn't the only reason for therise of One Nation but it sure helped. Each time Howard twisted the knifeof racism he strengthened One Nation. <p>Remember Howard holding up the map of Australia showing native title wouldapply just about everywhere and his podium thumping performance at thenational reconciliation conference? Each incident was laden with deceit anddouble meaning. Tim Fischer did his bit claiming that freehold title wasunder threat from native title.<p>It took the Queensland election to conclusively demonstrate that the Howardstrategy had bitten the Coalition hardest. That's why Howard was beaming tothe cameras after the passage of the Wik legislation. Escaping the gallowsmust be an exhilarating experience.<p>He didn't deserve to be let off so lightly. In courting the racist voteHoward exposed his own character deficiency. He demeaned the office ofPrime Minister and set race relations back 30 years. Australia has lost agolden opportunity to become a fairer country.'<br clear=all><p><center><img src="http://www.electric.on.net/ads/ads_news/agriffiths_optometrist.gif" width=380 height=60 border=0></center><p><center><hr noshade><A HREF="http://www.electric.on.net"        onMouseOver="waxon('home');        statuson('home'); return true;"        onMouseOut="statusoff(); waxoff('home');        return true;"><IMG name=home SRC="../buttons/butt_home_off.gif" ALT="home" WIDTH="140" HEIGHT="32" BORDER="0"></a><A HREF="../essays/index.html"        onMouseOver="waxon('essays');        statuson('essays'); return true;"        onMouseOut="statusoff(); waxoff('essays');        return true;"><IMG name=essays SRC="../buttons/butt_essays_off.gif" ALT="essays" WIDTH="140" HEIGHT="32" BORDER="0"></a><hr noshade></center><p><A HREF="http://www.electric.on.net">http://www.electric.on.net</A><p>&copy; This work is subject to copyright.
