MikeElliott is the Leader and Sandra Kanck is the deputy Leader, which mustleave Ian Gilfillan, the former leader of the Democrats, just a little bitmiffed.  <p>Sandra Kanck has formulated the Democrats' attitude to the proposed ETSAprivatisation.  The Kanck Report which opposed the sale of ETSA was madepublic on June 25.  However, last week in Parliament, the Treasurer, RobLucas blew the Democrats' stobie poles out of the ground and left themwire-less!<p>Ms Kanck made much of the fact that the Democrats' decision had beenreached after 1,000 hours of research.  But the lack of logic and errorscontained in this report indicated that 1,000 hours was not enough. <p>In South Australia Optima is responsible for the generation of electricity. The Kanck Report stated "... Optima should be maintained in its currentstructure, and other private companies encouraged to set up gas firedgeneration capacity in South Australia."  In the following paragraph Kanckargued "if Optima is to be separated, it's possible that dividends wouldsuffer.  Conversely its potential sale price would be reduced, underminingthe government's debt reduction arguments."<p>In other words, Ms Kanck was clearly against breaking up Optima into two orthree companies competing against each other.  There can be no otherconstruction put on her statement.  <p>The intelligent readers of The Electric Newspaper (aren't they all?) willno doubt remember that on May 7 Ms Kanck wrote an article about ETSA.However, in that article she was singing a different tune.  Kanck wrote"disaggregation should be a priority of the government.  Not only would itguarantee competition payments, but it will also result in greaterefficiency within the industry."  <p>The Treasurer also noted an article which had appeared in The Advertiser onJuly 1, where Ms Kanck was quoted on the Democrat position ondisaggregation - "Ms Kanck said that, while she had concerns about howOptima would be split, she felt ‘comfortable' with seven government ownedcorporations competing in the National Electricity Market." <p>The Kanck Report reaffirmed that Optima should not be broken up when itnoted "In the South Australian market Optima will effectively exercisemonopoly control.  By strategic bidding Optima can set the regional poolprice between 60% and 96% of the time.  As a result of the scrapping ofRiverlink, Optima's market control is increased."  Rob Lucas made the veryobvious point that if Optima, as a monopoly, can set the price ofelectricity for up to 96% of the time, there will logically be a higherlevel of prices under the Democrat model than if there is a disaggregatedOptima with a number of companies competing against each other.  <p>And yet the Democrats claim that ETSA should not be sold because thegovernment will lose the dividend which it currently receives from ETSA.And how is that dividend obtained?  Yes, from the profits achieved by ETSA. As Rob Lucas told the Legislative Council, "if you are going to allowOptima, as one Optima, to exercise monopoly control over price for up to96% of the time and you also want to maintain or increase dividend flow togovernment, the only policy option as a result of that is that the longsuffering consumers out there will have to pay higher electricity pricesunder the Democrat or Kanck model of the electricity industry here in SouthAustralia."<p>But that was not the only stumble in the Democrat grumble.  An officialDemocrat pamphlet outlining the arguments against the ETSA sale claims "AWorld Bank study has shown UK shareholders are up to $4 billion worse offbecause of electricity privatisation."  That sounds like a pretty goodargument, except it is totally untrue.  It is not a World Bank report atall, but rather the precis of a report by some academics which happened tobe published in a World Bank journal, which carries a clear disclaimer that"the views published are those of the authors and should not be attributedto the World Bank or any of its affiliated organisations.  Nor do any ofthe conclusions represent official policy of the World Bank ...".  <p>If Sandra Kanck wants to properly quote the World Bank view she should beadvising the South Australian community that the World Bank has in factconsistently recommended that governments should privatise utility servicesand has spent millions of dollars in supporting this objective.<p>And why didn't the Kanck Report tell the truth about electricityprivatisation in the UK, where both residential and industrial electricityprices in real terms have fallen by around 20% over the last 8 years andwhere complaints by consumers have fallen by nearly 60% since 1991?  <p>With the pressure mounting against these flaws in the Democrats' argument,Ms Kanck simply lost it in the Legislative Council last week.  On WednesdayJuly 1 at the end of Question Time Ms Kanck claimed she had beenmisrepresented.  She suggested that in my question to the Treasurer I hadtaken quotes from the Kanck Report out of context.  But I had not evenquoted from the Kanck Report.  She claimed that Rob Lucas had got it wrongwhen he said he had examined the six page Democrats' analysis on ETSAappearing on the Internet.  However, I was the one that had made thestatement, not Rob Lucas.  Kanck claimed the analysis ran to 10 pages plusappendices.  <p>Dear readers, if you would like to check Kanck's numeracy, take a trip withme to  <A HREF="http://www.electric.on.net/news/26June-democrats.html">http://www.electric.on.net/news/26June-democrats.html</A> and count thenumber of pages on the Democrat analysis.  Yes, it is six.  <p>A thousand hours of research by Kanck has produced sloppy and inaccurateinformation and the Australian Democrats' position has fluctuated from weekto week on the important question of Optima's dissaggregation.  Kanck'sperformance in the Legislative Council last week was an embarrassment.  Shecouldn't even recall accurately what had been said minutes earlier.<br clear=all><p><center><img src="http://www.electric.on.net/ads/ads_news/agriffiths_optometrist.gif" width=380 height=60 border=0></center><p><center><hr noshade><A HREF="http://www.electric.on.net"        onMouseOver="waxon('home');        statuson('home'); return true;"        onMouseOut="statusoff(); waxoff('home');        return true;"><IMG name=home SRC="../buttons/butt_home_off.gif" ALT="home" WIDTH="140" HEIGHT="32" BORDER="0"></a><A HREF="../essays/index.html"        onMouseOver="waxon('essays');        statuson('essays'); return true;"        onMouseOut="statusoff(); waxoff('essays');        return true;"><IMG name=essays SRC="../buttons/butt_essays_off.gif" ALT="essays" WIDTH="140" HEIGHT="32" BORDER="0"></a><hr noshade></center><p><A HREF="http://www.electric.on.net">http://www.electric.on.net</A><p>&copy; This work is subject to copyright.
