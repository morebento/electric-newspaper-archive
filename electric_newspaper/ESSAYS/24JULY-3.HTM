And then he said, "If the case that has been made out by thePremier of New South Wales and the Treasurer, Michael Egan, to sell offtheir electricity assets in New South Wales is a compelling one, then onecan draw their own conclusion from an economic analysis of South Australia."<p>Cameron then drove a stake through the heart of Mike Rann'santi-privatisation argument when he said, "The only conclusion one couldcome to is that the case must be more compelling in South Australia than itis in New South Wales because the economic fundamentals in South Australiaare much worse than those in New South Wales.  Our per capita debt is muchhigher, and it does not matter what economic statistic one looks at:  weare performing at a worse level than is New South Wales.  As I have said,the only conclusion to which I can come to date on the material at which Ihave looked is that it would be in the best economic interests of SouthAustralia and its people for ETSA to be sold."<p>Cameron continued ".... if Bob Carr and Michael Egan want to sell the NewSouth Wales electricity authority (for $22 billion) with a State debt of$13.2 billion ... one would have to be an economic idiot to come to anyother conclusion.  If they have made a compelling case in New South Wales,then we must have even more compelling reasons in this State for gettingrid of ETSA."<p>So there you have it - the genie is out of the bottle.  Cameron has had thecourage to say publicly what I have been told at least 11 other LaborMembers of Parliament have been saying privately.<p>And what was Labor Leader Mike (Also) Rann's response to Cameron'sstatement?  The Advertiser of Friday 24 reported that Rann had warned MrCameron he faced automatic expulsion from the Labor Party if he crossed thefloor to support the Government.  Mr Rann in a statement said that MrCameron had "not raised his concerns during the ALP policy convention whichunanimously confirmed our position on the ETSA privatisation or during theParliamentary party's discussions on the ETSA Bill."<p>Let me just remind readers what's happening here.  The Labor Party in SouthAustralia set down their opposition to the privatisation of ETSA at an ALPconvention in October 1996 - that's nearly two years ago.  The world hasmoved on since then.  In New South Wales the Labor Premier and Treasurerare committed to privatising power and you can't get enough money on thefact it will happen after the next State election, whichever Party winsoffice.  <p>So how can Rann threaten Cameron with expulsion for agreeing with LaborPremier Carr and Treasurer Egan?  It's a neat point.  <p>While on the subject of Rann, you might remember that in my column lastweek I asked him to respond to three simple questions.  Now the LaborMembers tell me Rann is an avid supporter of The Electric Newspaper and hecertainly would have read my column or at the very least have had it drawnto his attention.  <p>The three questions I asked last week were:<p><BLOCKQUOTE><B>Question 1</B>	Can Rann guarantee that ETSA's current profitability will remain 		undiminished in this new competitive National Electricity Market, 		which will be dramatically different from the monopoly position which 		ETSA now enjoys?<p><B>Question 2</B>	Can Rann guarantee that ETSA and Optima's sale value will		remain undiminished in the face of this new competitive National		Electricity Market?<p><B>Question 3</B>	Will Rann guarantee categorically that he will not sell ETSA and		Optima in the unlikely event of him becoming Premier after the		next State election?</BLOCKQUOTE><p>These are the answers received from Rann to date:<p>Question 1:<br>Question 2:<br>Question 3:<p>I am sure readers will be as interested as I am to receive Mike's answersto these important questions.  <p>The sad thing about Labor's opposition to the privatisation of ETSA is thatin their hearts the leadership team knows it is right.  Impeccable Laborsources tell me that Rann and his Deputy Leader, Annette Hurley, along withTreasury spokesman, Kevin Foley, and Finance spokesman, Paul Holloway, allsupport privatisation.  Of the leadership group, only Carolyn Pickles isagainst privatisation.  <p>But Terry Cameron has flicked the switch and the arc light is now firmlyswinging over the Labor Party's position on this critical legislation -unarguably the most important the Parliament has debated since the RoxbyDowns Bill in 1982.  <br clear=all><p><center><img src="http://www.electric.on.net/ads/ads_news/agriffiths_optometrist.gif" width=380 height=60 border=0></center><p><center><hr noshade><A HREF="http://www.electric.on.net"        onMouseOver="waxon('home');        statuson('home'); return true;"        onMouseOut="statusoff(); waxoff('home');        return true;"><IMG name=home SRC="../buttons/butt_home_off.gif" ALT="home" WIDTH="140" HEIGHT="32" BORDER="0"></a><A HREF="../essays/index.html"        onMouseOver="waxon('essays');        statuson('essays'); return true;"        onMouseOut="statusoff(); waxoff('essays');        return true;"><IMG name=essays SRC="../buttons/butt_essays_off.gif" ALT="essays" WIDTH="140" HEIGHT="32" BORDER="0"></a><hr noshade></center><p><A HREF="http://www.electric.on.net">http://www.electric.on.net</A><p>&copy; This work is subject to copyright.
