In the bad oldSoviet Union private capital was evil. The State was the beneficial ownerof all property on behalf of the people. <p>This was the logical outcome of great theoretical concepts espoused by Marxand Lenin. It was generally accepted that the Western Democracies were on apath of moral and economic decay. This was the honestly held view of thevast majority of citizens. Sure, they had been influenced by aState-controlled media and dissent could be dangerous. But this was theprevailing view. Anyone looking at the new Russia, run by gangsters andthugs, might be excused for looking back fondly to the old days.<p>In Germany another conventional wisdom was promoted by similar coercivemeans. Most citizens accepted that Germany had been "stabbed in the back"by cowards and communists at the end of the first World War. Most citizensaccepted Hitler's program to restore prosperity and National pride.<p>During the cold-war, it was dangerous for an Australian to publicly embracea view at odds with the Bob Menzies world view. One risked being branded asa "communist". Once branded as a communist, a citizen was marginalised andexcluded. Eventually, anyone with whom one disagreed could be labelled as acommunist and vilified. This was very handy. One did not have to considerthe issue at hand. One did not have to muster arguments. By attaching thelabel "communist " to an opponent, the opponent was reduced to the statusof a dangerous fool. Arguments were not won, opponents were destroyed.<p>Political correctness is the name that is now given to thiswell-established shabby political technique. During the last decade or so,social trendies have taken to using it. They have done this to theexclusion of conducting any debate. Any idea which is at all challenging,is as a matter of course, derided as "sexist" or "racist". At long lastthis fraud on the democratic process is being exposed. In the arena ofsocial policy the exposure is well advanced but it is still with us.<p>The last bastion of political correctness is economics. This is the fieldin which political correctness is most deeply entrenched. It is as ifeconomic theory has been elevated to the level of a "truth". What is thisgreat "truth" ? That there is an international "level playing field". Thatthe "market" will deliver equitable solutions to the eternal problem ofdividing the cake. That "globalism" is unstoppable, inevitable and good forAustralia.<p>This great economic "truth" is as all pervasive in Australia today as theSoviet and German "truths" of the 1930's were in their time. It is everybit as flawed. If nothing is done, this country is headed for real trouble.Increasingly our Governments have handed over sovereignty to speculatorsand private corporations with no vested interest in our people. The publicare sick of it and are looking for a voice.<p>If One Nation persists in refusing to play the political game, we may yetsee a debate about these "truths". The established parties still have noidea what is emerging all around them. They still think in terms of thecomfortable mutual silence on major issues which has squashed publicdebate. The Queensland election was a warning. Our political system ispoised to implode.<br clear=all><p><center><img src="http://www.electric.on.net/ads/ads_news/agriffiths_optometrist.gif" width=380 height=60 border=0></center><p><center><hr noshade><A HREF="http://www.electric.on.net"        onMouseOver="waxon('home');        statuson('home'); return true;"        onMouseOut="statusoff(); waxoff('home');        return true;"><IMG name=home SRC="../buttons/butt_home_off.gif" ALT="home" WIDTH="140" HEIGHT="32" BORDER="0"></a><A HREF="../essays/index.html"        onMouseOver="waxon('essays');        statuson('essays'); return true;"        onMouseOut="statusoff(); waxoff('essays');        return true;"><IMG name=essays SRC="../buttons/butt_essays_off.gif" ALT="essays" WIDTH="140" HEIGHT="32" BORDER="0"></a><hr noshade></center><p><A HREF="http://www.electric.on.net">http://www.electric.on.net</A><p>&copy; This work is subject to copyright.
