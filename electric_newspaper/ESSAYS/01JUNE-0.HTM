I am a recent appointee, but the previous Presiding Membercertainly had more than her share of controversy when the Committeereported on prostitution.  Eventually, the Committee of six brought downthree separate sets of recommendations. <p>Hopefully, the present Committee will reach consensus when it reports onthe enquiry into gambling in South Australia.<p>Our actual reference is to inquire into and report on the extent ofgambling addiction in South Australia and the social and economicconsequences of that level of addiction, the social, economic and othereffects of the introduction of gaming machines into South Australia, andany other related matters.<p>So it becomes clear that we are not, as is popularly believed, 'an inquiryinto gaming machines', but must make much more wide-ranging recommendations.<p>Certainly the current climate (ably assisted by the Honourable NickXenophon!), is to blame poker machines for all the evils of society frombankruptcy to bunions. Certainly there has been a heavy emphasis placed onthe gaming machine section of gambling by many of the 69 witnesses who haveappeared before us, but as a committee, we would be derelict in our duty tolook at only one section of an activity which has become very much a partof the Australian culture, gambling.<p>We have taken evidence from a broad range of representatives from all legalcodes of gambling - racing, lotteries, TAB, etc as well as psychologists,counsellors and members of the general public and must now try to bringdown findings which balance the rights of the individual with the socialand welfare needs of society.  How many problem gamblers are there?  Doestheir plight justify a "nanny state" attitude?  Are the businessesdisadvantaged offset by those that make a handsome profit?  What ofGovernment revenue and what price human misery?<p>It would be improper for me to make any comments which would in any waypre-empt the decisions of the Committee, so really I am severely restrictedin what I can say.  I merely wish to point out in your illustriouspublication that most parliamentary inquiries (and this one in particular)are considerably more complex than the daily press would have you believe.<p>Perhaps one of the most concerning aspects of gambling is the opening up ofinteractive and internet gambling.<p>Last month I attended the conference "Gambling, Technology & Society:Regulatory Challenges for the 21st Century" in Sydney which was sponsoredby the Australian Institute of Criminology in conjunction with theAustralian Institute for Gambling Research with Committee Members Mr JoeScalzi MP, Mr Michael Atkinson MP and two staff members.  Regulators, lawmakers, the gambling industry, churches, charities and counsellors in fact,most of the key players, were represented and the findings were a revelation.<p>We were quickly informed that internet and interactive gambling - evenvirtual casinos - are already available and will be widespread throughoutAustralia within a year or two.<p>Armed with a 'smart card', it will be possible to bet on anything,anywhere, 24 hours a day, without leaving home, with no guarantees and (atthis stage) no limits.  Can you imagine coming home from work to find yourpartner had bankrupted the family before lunch?  Suddenly poker machinesseem obsolete and quite innocent!<p>My view is that the personal tragedies we now hear about will beterrifyingly multiplied by this form of gambling - at least playing thepokies, patronising the TAB, going to the races, even buying a lotteryticket all require some form of human interaction, electronic gambling doesnot.<p>It was generally agreed by speakers at the conference that Australia has aninternational reputation second to none for its responsible regulation ofall forms of gambling and the consensus seemed to be that there needs to bea collaborative effort by all States and Territories to regulate.<p>An international collaborative effort would be even more effective, but isin fact, unlikely.  <p>There appeared to be three schools of thought on what form regulationshould take:<ol><li> Those, like Senator Grant Chapman from South Australia, who spokepassionately for total prohibition.  This is the stance being attempted bythe United States of America with its recently introduced Kyl Bill and mostwould agree that on the surface, this is an appealing solution.  But theyoung technocrats with whom I spoke assured me that prohibition simplymeans using off-shore facilities with no method of control.  They sayprohibition is impossible.<li> Those who would go down the 'laissez-faire' path of total deregulation(which mainly appeals to those who believe they can make a fortune out ofothers' gambling).    And<li> 'Carpé Diem' - seize the day - build on our world-wide reputation tointroduce fair regulation.</ol><p>Regulatory controls suggested included:<ul><li> Outlaw credit betting<li> Ensure games are fair, profitable and publicly acceptable (thus enticinggamblers to stay on-shore)<li> Regulate for self limits, that is individuals nominate a weekly/monthlyspending limit<li> Regulate for on-line counselling<li> Monitor website advertising.</ul><p>Certainly, there were more questions raised than answers given.  I amsomewhat heartened by the knowledge that gaming ministers throughoutAustralia are attempting to address the problem with draft regulations, butthere is little doubt that, as with information, the Œweb‚ will open afloodgate of gambling opportunities.  Legislators can only try to keep up.<p>As for the Social Development Committee Report on Gambling - watch this space!<p><font size=-1>* Caroline Schaefer, a Liberal Member of the Legislative Councill, isPresiding Member of the Social Development Committee</font><br clear=all><center><A HREF="mailto:lhearn@msnsa.com.au"><img src="http://www.electric.on.net/ads/ads_news/media_sales.gif" width=380 height=60 border=0></A></center><p><center><hr noshade><A HREF="http://www.electric.on.net"        onMouseOver="waxon('home');        statuson('home'); return true;"        onMouseOut="statusoff(); waxoff('home');        return true;"><IMG name=home SRC="../buttons/butt_home_off.gif" ALT="home" WIDTH="140" HEIGHT="32" BORDER="0"></a><A HREF="../essays/index.html"        onMouseOver="waxon('essays');        statuson('essays'); return true;"        onMouseOut="statusoff(); waxoff('essays');        return true;"><IMG name=essays SRC="../buttons/butt_essays_off.gif" ALT="essays" WIDTH="140" HEIGHT="32" BORDER="0"></a><hr noshade></center><p><A HREF="http://www.electric.on.net">http://www.electric.on.net</A><p>&copy; This work is subject to copyright.
