Somewords that refer to one or another aspect of human morality have historicalassociations so sweeping and so beneficial that there is an automaticreaction of pleasure or contentment when one encounters them.<p>Consider, on a less exalted plane, the following four terms:non-discrimination, dispute resolution, transparency, and harmonisation.The first three are readily equatable with, respectively, thetwentieth-century experience of the civil rights movement, the discovery ofways of avoiding war or other violence, and the demand for governmentbehaviour to occur in the sunshine, rather than in secret."Harmonisation'"is a bit harder to link to a particular social experiencebut in music it connotes a pleasant blend of the parts within the whole.<p>The MAI - Multilateral Agreement on Investment- conjured up in Paris by theOECD makes major use of the terms non-discrimination, dispute resolution,transparency, and harmonisation.  But these now signify something-different from their usual associations.  Non-discrimination, instead ofmeaning "Let’s be fair to every person equally" (or even "Let’s overcomeour bad habit of demeaning the humble") now means "Let’s give the Fortune500 a fair go". Seriously.  <p>In the proposed treaty, non-discrimination means no nation should committhe abominable deed of erecting a barrier to foreign investment.  Even atown council that has a policy of favouring the employment of locals isseen to be in need of some kind of enlightenment here.  They should stopdiscriminating.  The OECD will see to it that they do.  Any government thatsigns the MAI (have sheep ever gone so merrily to slaughter?) will beprohibited from "discriminating".<p>The next term, dispute resolution, has undergone an even more radicalchange.  What does the phrase connote to you?  Perhaps balance? compromise?justice?  Well, here’s what it connotes to the Paris Twenty-Nine.  Acorporation that is unhappy with (or let’s say, feels oppressed by) ahost-government, can take that government before a tribunal.  Will this bethe ICJ- the International Court of Justice (which has so far permittedonly states to bring action)?  No.  Will it be the domestic courts?  No.It is a new tribunal.  The wording is, "The tribunal may award pecuniarycompensation for any loss or damage to the requesting Party’s investor orinvestment ...Tribunal awards shall be final and binding."<p>  These tribunals have to do with the greatly extended concept of a foreigncorporation’s right to be compensated if new legislation, such asenvironmental protection, causes them to lose out on future profits.According to Robert Howse and Jonathan Feldman of the University of TorontoLaw Faculty (are you sitting down?), "The arbitration rules that apply toinvestor-state dispute settlement under the MAI contemplate a secretprocess, where neither the pleadings ... nor the reasons for decisions arepublic unless permitted by both parties."<p>As for the word transparency, it has not undergone such a redefinition asnon-discrimination and dispute resolution, since the original was neververy emotional anyway.  To be transparent is to be stripped of one’s tricksand deceits.  Because the MAI has to do with an almost impenetrable area -foreign investment (think of the tax loopholes known only to corporateaccountants), it might be expected that a new transparency is being urgedhere.  Wrong.  All states are now to be open about their regulations (nobad thing), but there is no comparable requirement for the investors.Indeed, the MAI is a remarkable contract, being entirely one-sided.  Itissues privileges to transnational corporations and demands nothing in return.<p>Finally, then, to harmonisation.  To hear the OECD hold forth on this is tobe reminded of the Australian heroine in Frank Moorhouse’s succulent novelGrand Days.  One of her first disappointments of working for the League ofNations consisted of facing the fact that Britain and Europe were nevergoing to harmonise their traffic rules because Brits were not going to giveup (even for "world peace") their driving on the left-side.  Still, the MAIwriters have more clout than the League of Nations:  they could succeed inbringing "harmony".  For this, they need not persuade states to make newlaws, but only to get rid of laws.  To harmonise by deregulation is thesublime goal.  The point of the globalised economy is, after all, to breakdown those irritating state obstructions.<p>Perhaps we need a new Orwell to deal with this on-beyond-Newspeak.  Italiansemiotician Umberto Eco, in his book of political essays Faith in Fakes,recommends that we who are on the receiving end of coded messages mustsimply practise decoding them.  The Africans have already found a way todecode SAPs (Structural Adjustment Policies): they call SAP "sufferingAfrican people".  Whenever the IMF orders structural adjustment, it tellsthe state to diminish itself.  National industries must be privatised;subsidies need to be cut, exports must be emphasised, and so forth.  Thebudget for health and education (the "real" investment) is slashed.Maternal deaths in childbirth reportedly doubled in Harare when fees forhospital admissions were introduced under Zimbabwe’s structural adjustment. (See Kevin Danaher’s Fifty Years is Enough.)<p>I recommend we decode "MAI" to reveal its main purpose - the MaximumAvoidance of Irritants: the irritants being laws, states, cultures and, inthe final analysis, people.  More importantly, I recommend that we preventthe global economisers from expanding into the space of our emotional andmoral language by occupying it, ourselves, with that with which it issupposed to be occupied.<p>Let’s chat up "humanitarianism" and "civilisation" before these, too, getoverlain with some pathetic and disgusting new definition.<p><font size=-1>* Mary Maxwell earned her PhD in Politics at the University of Adelaide.Her speciality is the sociobiology of international behaviour. She was oneof three speakers on the subject of the MAI at a meeting of the AustralianInstitute of International Affairs at the University on Wednesday 15 April.<p>With thanks to the Adelaidean.</font><p><center><hr noshade><A HREF="http://www.electric.on.net"        onMouseOver="waxon('home');        statuson('home'); return true;"        onMouseOut="statusoff(); waxoff('home');        return true;"><IMG name=home SRC="../buttons/butt_home_off.gif" ALT="home" WIDTH="140" HEIGHT="32" BORDER="0"></a><A HREF="../essays/index.html"        onMouseOver="waxon('essays');        statuson('essays'); return true;"        onMouseOut="statusoff(); waxoff('essays');        return true;"><IMG name=essays SRC="../buttons/butt_essays_off.gif" ALT="essays" WIDTH="140" HEIGHT="32" BORDER="0"></a><hr noshade></center><p><A HREF="http://www.electric.on.net">http://www.electric.on.net</A><p>&copy; This work is subject to copyright.
