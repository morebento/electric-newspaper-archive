Many of these issues come down to looking out for "the devil inthe detail".<p>Other  issues are ones of principle or conceptual architecture. I willillustrate these different types of issue by way of example. Before doingso however, I would first like to set MAI in some historical perspective.<p>We are now passing through a period of great economic, social, politicaland technological change. In retrospect, this will be seen as one of thegreat transitions in human history . The new world which is rapidlyemerging is stripped bare of old beliefs and values . Cultures andindividuals are being cut loose from their roots. Globalism intrudes intoall facets of life.<p>The evidence is all around us.  It is only by looking back that the extentof change becomes obvious. A new economic dogma based on the blind wisdomof the market is in the ascendancy.  A popular culture of "the self"corrodes our sense of community and Nation. Business is not  trusted.Politicians are viewed with contempt. Corruption in high office is viewedwith resignation by a powerless population. Institutions of democraticGovernment are increasingly seen as  ineffectual apologists for big money.  It would be foolish to suggest that any individual amongst us can halt thisprocess.  For the time being, at least, our collective voice is howeverpowerful enough to make a difference. <p>In the years since the end of the Second World War, the global economy hasexpanded beyond recognition. In 1945, Germany, the powerhouse of Europe,was a pile of rubble and ashes. Japan, the economic engine of Asia, wasoccupied, broke and starving. How things have changed. These countries havesubstantially achieved through commerce what they failed to achieve throughconquest.<p>The rise of the Trans National Corporation (TNC) has occurred since the War. TNCs are based overwhelmingly in First World Countries. The OECD is the"Club" of first world Nations. <p>477 of the global fortune 500 corporations have their home bases in OECDcountries. In other words, 95.4% of the largest Trans National Corporationsare headquartered in member countries of the OECD.<p>TNCs are large enough in many cases to have interests and objectives quiteindependent of those motivating a host country. TNCs are the most powerfulinstitutions yet devised for the exploitation of resources and theaccumulation of wealth. Their power  is proportional to their wealth.History shows that they have few moral scruples when the pursuit of profitis at strake. Bribery and corruption have been weapons in their armory. <p>TNCs have ready access to governments at top level. Through lobbyists andother agents of influence , they quietly work on politicians andbureaucrats alike. Their agenda is being advanced simultaneously across theglobe.<p>Within the OECD, the distribution of wealth and power is very uneven. TheUnited States, the European Union and Japan are the big players. Othermember countries, including Australia , are basically along to make up thenumbers. <p>The agenda of the TNCs and their partners, the global banks, is to set inplace a series of international guidelines which will produce a secureenvironment that is "good for business". TNCs want a "big stick" toguarantee them certain rights as against Nation States. This is MAI.<p>OECD Nations will be encouraged to sign up.In due course, other poorerNations will  be obliged to join on the same terms . MAI will not be easyto get out of either. Upwards of 20 years notice could be required toextract a Nation from MAI.<p>MAI will give TNCs enforceable legal rights to recover damages from Nationswhich do not observe the Treaty. Damages will be determined by anInternational Tribunal. Failure by a Nation to comply with an order of thisTribunal, from which there is no appeal, would result in ostracism andpossibly, sanctions. <p>It is proposed that the MAI Draft will be finalised by May of 1998. Itappears that the Federal Government is seriously considering signing.<p>The potential consequences for Australians of submitting to MAI areenormous.  <p>I would now like to illustrate a principle or conceptual architectureissue, mentioned in my opening remarks.<p>MAI treats Nations and TNCs essentially as equals. In terms of their sheereconomic power , this is a recognition of reality . TNCs are given theright to sue Sovereign Nations for damages if those Nations exercise theirConstitutional powers in a way considered to offend the terms of theTreaty. It is beyond argument that this compromises National Sovereignty .<p>It is arguable that in extreme cases, for example expropriation of assetsby a despotic government, this may have merit. This depends of course onhow you define "expropriation".<p>There may be sound reasons for a Nation to elect to compromise itself inthis way. Most International agreements involve some degree of compromise.Whether such a compromise is warranted in any particular case, comes downto a cost benefit analysis. <p>MAI is unusual in that it gives rights not to Nations but to TNCs.  Nationsobtain no enforceable rights in return. At best they are offered the woollypromise of an environment that is "good for business"and all the usualempty assurances about more jobs .<p>As a very minimum, MAI should be a reciprocal charter of rights andresponsibilities. TNCs responsibilities might for example include paymentof proper taxation in a host country, observance of ILO Labor regulations,or environmental standards. At present it is a one way street. All rightsfor the TNCs, but no responsibilities.This is quite simply a bad deal.<p>Examples of the "devil in the detail" are potentially limited only by one'simagination. Take for example exemptions, or the lack of them, under MAI.<p>MAI is designed to apply in its entirety unless a specific exemption issought by  and granted to a Nation. Circumstances, unforseen at the time ofnegotiation of the Treaty, will not be exempted. Even exemptions sought andgranted will have to be continually reviewed and if possible, wound back.<p>Take a very local example. SANTOS is one of the few major corporations witha major presence in SA. This is no accident .The South AustralianParliament passed the SANTOS [Regulation of Shareholding] Act in 1979 toprotect SANTOS from a then threatened take-over by Alan Bond. Just as wellas it turned out! <p>This Act was amended in 1989, but the law remains that so long as SANTOS orany subsidiary, engages in the recovery and production of petroleum in SA,no person or corporation may own more than 15 % of the shares.<p>MAI is designed to remove all impediments to investment and restrictions onthe flow of capital.  Assume for a moment that Exon wanted to buy SANTOS.As far as I am aware, there is no proposal to exempt this Act of the SAParliament from the operation of MAI. It is impossible to know how manyother pieces of legislation, passed in the interest of South Australians,to which no one has yet turned their mind, are lurking out there. <p>MAI may oblige the Federal Parliament to pass a law overriding the SA Act,or risk leaving Australia open to litigation and a possible claim fordamages  by any TNC, denied full access to the SANTOS share register.<p> Similar questions could be raised about a privatised ETSA, or theCommonwealth Bank, or Qantas.<p>Similar problems emerge for cross-media ownership and foreign investmentguidelines in other sectors of the economy .<p>Australian content rules, restrictions on violent films and any culturalprotection from total Americanization may also be threatened.<p>These are all complex issues and they require public debate. Make it yourbusiness to raise this debate. Silence now may be repented at length.<p><hr noshade><p><A HREF="http://www.electric.on.net">http://www.electric.on.net</A><p>&copy; This work is subject to copyright.
