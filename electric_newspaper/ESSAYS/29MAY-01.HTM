Henoted that when the Liberal Party came to Government in December 1993, it"faced the daunting prospect of a budget in which we were spending over$300 million a year more than we were earning, a State mortgage out ofcontrol and ballooning towards $9 million and unfunded superannuationliabilities estimated at $4 billion and growing alarmingly."<p>The Treasurer noted that over the past four years the debt has been reducedby nearly $2 billion.  This means that debt is now less than 20% of GrossState Product, compared with 28% in 1992.  In addition, the State'ssuperannuation liability has been reduced by close to $900 million.  <p>The Treasurer outlined a four-year financial plan, which commits theGovernment to balanced budgets, a continuing reduction in debt and theelimination of all unfunded superannuation liabilities by 2024.  However,the key to implementing this programme is the privatisation of ETSA andOptima.<p>The Lucas message was blunt.  If the sale of ETSA and Optima was blocked inParliament, the Government would be forced to introduce a mini-budget inOctober to provide for up to $150 million in tax increases or expenditurecuts, to take effect within the four-year financial period.  <p>This is financial reality in South Australia in 1998.  <p>The Labor Party, which vehemently opposes the privatisation of ETSA andOptima, does not have a crooked leg to stand on.  The Hawke/KeatingGovernments privatised the Commonwealth Bank, Australian Airlines, Qantasand Commonwealth Serum Laboratories and were in favour of at least apartial privatisation of Telstra.  The State Government, in which currentLabor Leader, Mike (Also) Rann was a key player, privatised the State Bankand sold the the Government's dominant shareholding in the South AustralianGas Company.  <p>In my Electric Newspaper article of May 8 ("Take Your Money and Rann") Ioffered a free lunch and tour of Parliament House to any reader who couldprovide me with a speech of Rann criticising the Federal and State LaborGovernments' privatisation initiatives.  My e-mail "In"mailbox on thissubject has been, not surprisingly, empty and I have placed the lunch inthe deep freeze!  <p>The reality is that if the ETSA/Optima sale does not proceed, SouthAustralia will continue to have a debt of over $7 billion which requiresinterest payments of $2 million a day and no AAA credit rating.  If thesale does not proceed, South Australia will be forced to compete againstother electricity authorities in the Eastern States, which are already orlikely to be privatised.  The State will remain vulnerable to increasedinterest rates and other adverse economic trends.  If the sale does notproceed and the debt remains, you do not have to be a financial whiz torealise there will be less money available to be spent on health care,education, the environment and other important community services.<p>A key component of the budget is a $99 million commitment to providetraineeships for more than 4,600 people, including 1,500 in small business. There has also been a strong recognition of the environment, with spendingon State parks up to $22 million - $5 million more than 2 years ago and adoubling in new State funding for the Natural Heritage Trust to $6.8million.  <p>Significant wage increases in the public sector have flowed through to a4.5% increase in fees and charges in the 1998/99 budget.  However, Lucasnoted that "State taxation per capita in South Australia will be $130 lowerthan the national average and the third lowest of all States andTerritories."  There will be a differential tax rate on gaming machines forclubs and hotels.  Clubs and community hotels will benefit from a drop inthe tax rate because the Government recognises they return a significantproportion of their revenue to the community.<p>There is a pleasing increase of 8% in real terms in capital worksexpenditure of $1.24 billion.  This includes $43 million for theredevelopment of the Queen Elizabeth Hospital, a $55 million upgrade of theAdelaide Convention Centre, $100 million for the Alice Springs-Darwin raillink and a refurbishment of the State Library.  <p>This is a responsible budget which reflects financial reality.  Ironically,its critics include the very same people who were responsible forrecklessly wrecking the State's finances.  It will be interesting to seehow they now confront reality.<br clear=all><center><A HREF="mailto:lhearn@msnsa.com.au"><img src="http://www.electric.on.net/ads/ads_news/media_sales.gif" width=380 height=60 border=0></A></center><p><center><hr noshade><A HREF="http://www.electric.on.net"        onMouseOver="waxon('home');        statuson('home'); return true;"        onMouseOut="statusoff(); waxoff('home');        return true;"><IMG name=home SRC="../buttons/butt_home_off.gif" ALT="home" WIDTH="140" HEIGHT="32" BORDER="0"></a><A HREF="../essays/index.html"        onMouseOver="waxon('essays');        statuson('essays'); return true;"        onMouseOut="statusoff(); waxoff('essays');        return true;"><IMG name=essays SRC="../buttons/butt_essays_off.gif" ALT="essays" WIDTH="140" HEIGHT="32" BORDER="0"></a><hr noshade></center><p><A HREF="http://www.electric.on.net">http://www.electric.on.net</A><p>&copy; This work is subject to copyright.
