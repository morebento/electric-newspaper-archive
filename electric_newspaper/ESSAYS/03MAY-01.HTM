In narrow financial terms thesale of the industry does not begin to make any economic sense unlessthe sale price exceeds $7 billion. <p>Even at this price losses can be expected if the industry grows in linewith State GSP - a not totallyunreasonable expectation. If this were the case taxpayers would make anet loss of nearly $900 million. These figures have not been plucked outof the air. They are the result of a detailed economic analysisundertaken by Professor John Quiggin and I and released this week. <p>The study has been largely ignored, with the media preferring to focus on themore colourful question of whether the Government had plans to privatiseETSA/Optima before the election. Well of course it did. It has beenpolitically and ideologically committed to the sale of ETSA for years, ashave been a few key Labor Party figures. <p>In political terms the sale ofthe industry would provide a warchest to suit short term politicalneeds. Some debt could be retired to make the books look a bit betterand some spending could be undertaken in politically sensitive areassuch as health and education. This could be just what it takes tore-elect the government unless a serious ETSA induced implosion withinthe leadership occurs over the next few months.<p>The key to the sale of ETSA is in the hands of the Democrats. They arecarefully weighing up the evidence and will be faced with a difficultpolitical decision. The economic evidence is clear - the sale will be anet loss to taxpayers in the medium term. Equally compelling is the factthat privatisation of electricity has almost uniformly resulted in anincrease in prices for domestic consumers.  <p>Over the 1989-91 period, domestic electricity tariffs in Britain rose by28 percent or 4 percent above the rate inflation. Perversely the cost ofcoal in 1991 was 27 per cent cheaper than it was in 1988. If thisdecline in coal prices had been translated into a reduction in prices,the unit price for domestic consumers would have been around 8 percentless in real terms.<p>A 1997 World Bank study on the restructuring and privatisation of the UKelectricity industry found that despite estimated efficiency savingsbetween 6-11 billion pounds which translate into potential pricereductions of 3.2 to 7.5 percent, prices did not fall as fast as costs.Indeed consumers were found to have experienced a significant loss fromthe reforms of between 1.3 and 4.4 billion pounds. <p>On the other handshareholders were found to have gained significantly with National Powerand PowerGen share prices increasing by around 300 percent since publicfloat. The study also found that around 25 percent of the net gains fromprivatisation were transferred out of the country through therepatriation of profits. <p>In New Zealand, while the wholesale price of electricity declined by 17percent in real terms domestic costs have increased by 20 percent inreal terms over ten years since corporatisation in 1987 (Smith,1997:36).<p>Since privatisation of the electricity industry in Victoria there hasbeen a doubling of the connection fee for domestic users from around$16.00 to $34.00. Since privatisation in 1995 electricity prices show nosign of declining. <p>Recent evidence on water prices following outsourcing of Adelaide’smetropolitan water and sewerage supply can only reinforce concern aboutprices under privatisation. In this case claimed savings of around 20percent from outsourcing have not been passed onto customers. Sinceoutsourcing of the service in 1996 bills for average water use haverisen by 6.7 percent.<p>The sale of the South Australian electricity industry makes no economicsense and it will inevitably lead to higher prices for domesticcustomers.<p>Futhermore the argument that the Government runs the risk of loosing $1billion in competition payments from the Federal Government if itretains ETSA in public ownership is a fallacy. The Auditor-Generalconfirmed in his 1997 Annual report that there is no immediate risk tothe payment of the first tranche of competition payments due in 1998-99.<p>The question of ownership of the industry is irrelevant to compliancewith competition policy as the 1995 COAG agreement itself makes clear. Itsays, "This agreement is neutral with respect to the nature and form ofownership of business enterprises. It is not intended to promote publicor private ownership." <p>This view on the ownership of the industry was also reflected in theIndustry Commission’s review of ETSA in a 1996 report for the StateGovernment, which said,  "The South Australian Government would not beprevented from continuing to own the various businesses which would becreated by restructuringETSA along the lines proposed."<p>The final word on whether ETSA will be sold or not remains with theDemocrats. If the sale is blocked the spectre of a 99 year lease looms.This is equivalent to a sale and must be rejected as such. The LaborParty and the Democrats have the capacity to ensure that this does notproceed by firstly opposing a lease and secondly by publicly proclaimingthat they will take all steps to bring the industry back into publicmanagement when political circumstances change. These are the politicalchallenges ahead. In the end the Liberals, Labor and the Democrats willbe judged against the test of whether they have put short term politicalgains ahead of the longer term public interest.<p><center><hr noshade><A HREF="http://www.electric.on.net"        onMouseOver="waxon('home');        statuson('home'); return true;"        onMouseOut="statusoff(); waxoff('home');        return true;"><IMG name=home SRC="../buttons/butt_home_off.gif" ALT="home" WIDTH="140" HEIGHT="32" BORDER="0"></a><A HREF="../essays/index.html"        onMouseOver="waxon('essays');        statuson('essays'); return true;"        onMouseOut="statusoff(); waxoff('essays');        return true;"><IMG name=essays SRC="../buttons/butt_essays_off.gif" ALT="essays" WIDTH="140" HEIGHT="32" BORDER="0"></a><hr noshade></center><p><A HREF="http://www.electric.on.net">http://www.electric.on.net</A><p>&copy; This work is subject to copyright.
