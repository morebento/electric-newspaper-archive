Professors mingled with students in black                armbands. Volunteers blocked stairways in university                buildings with metal rods, tables and blackboards. Student                motorcyclists arrived in noisy convoys, carrying huge wreaths                with messages of defiance from other universities.<p>                Onlookers crowded round a list of victims pinned up in a                room beside a yellowing poster of Princess Diana. An angry                economics student showed me a newspaper photograph of a                young woman lying on the road, arm outstretched in death.                "They kicked her after she was shot and threw her body in a                lorry," he said furiously.<p>                A long white cloth was stretched out on a wall for written                comments. A student interpreter who was helping me said,                "Excuse me," and took out a felt pen to write "We'll continue                our fight, my friends." Then she cried. One of the students                killed had been her friend in first-year economics, she                explained. "He rang me to say he wanted to demonstrate."<p>                Others wrote: "People power", "Peace Man", "I hate                Suharto", "Suharto must go", "Keep on fighting, don't give                up". On a wall nearby someone had painted in large red                letters, in English, "Suharto and ABRI - murderers". ABRI is                the initials of the Indonesian army.<p>                At first the army was nowhere to be seen. A campus rally                began in searing heat at 10 a.m. when the leaders of                Indonesia's opposition arrived to condemn the shootings and                urge the students to keep demonstrating. The students                shouted "Freedom" and thrust their fists in the air. It hadthe                atmosphere of Tiananmen Square in 1989 and the same                simplicity - and some of the same features, as many students                at Trisakti are ethnic Chinese.<p>                "What do you mean by freedom?" I asked a 19-year-old                economics student. "Suharto must go down," she said, as                several of her friends yelled agreement. A 22year-old                engineering undergraduate said: "Freedom? We want                freedom just from this horrible situation, and democracy, of                course."<p>                The matronly Megawati Sukarnoputrai, daughter of the                former Indonesian president, was given a tumultuous                welcome at her first student demonstration. The                pro-democracy activist is respected as a rallying figure,                though not as a future leader. "Whoever killed our friends                committed crimes against humanity," Megawati cried to loud                cheers. "Soldiers, do not use force against our own children."<p>                The diminutive Islamic leader, Amien Rais, leader of a                Muslim organisation claiming 28 million members, said ABRI                had two choices, to support President Suharto or the people.                "We are going to demonstrate, we are not going to stop until                reform is complete," he cried. "Our friends' deaths must                inspire us to extra courage. We must unify to be victorious."                The approval of senior university staff mingling with the                students signified that public support for their cause is                widening, particularly among the middle classes.<p>                The students turned angry when Suryadi, the leader of the                Indonesian Democratic Party (PDI), who had ousted                Megawati in a coup two years ago, dared to try to join the                student bandwagon. Stones were thrown and one hit him. <p>                University officials hustled him inside the main buildingjust as                several bangs came from the nearby street and tear-gas                drifted on to the campus and penetrated every room, and                even the elevator which I was taking to get a rooftop view. It                was packed with gasping people, including elderly women in                elegant robes. In the corridors of the 11-storey edifice,staff                handed out masks and water bottles. Meanwhile students                from other colleges and local people, furious about the                shootings, had massed in the streets outside, and the riot                police appeared and took up position. <p>                Trisakti University had suspended its demonstrations for a                day to honour the dead, and dozens of activists in blue                blazers held back their own students as excitement mounted.<p>                A leader called Adam said: "I'm afraid things will get out of                control." They soon did. At 12.30 the crowd outside moved                down the road, and immediately a volley of shots rang out                from soldiers at a petrol station and they ran back, stumbling                over road dividers. Some protesters hijacked a rubbish truck                and set in alight. They pulled down a lamp-post with two                large light globes, and bent metal railings level with the                ground.<p>                For the next four hours shots rang out every few minutes as                near-anarchy developed around the campus, which remained                a haven as security forces are banned by law from entering.                By mid-afternoon plumes of dark smoke were billowing up                around the university from burning petrol stations and                makeshift barricades. <p>                Crowds gathered across the motorway in front of a                glass-walled shopping plaza advertising The Body Shop and                Dunkin' Donuts. They cheered when protesters, many from a                poor area nearby, taunted the police and threw bottles, and                ran helter-skelter when troops fired rubber bullets in their                direction, then repeated the whole thing over again.<p>                Further down the road a crowd casually broke the windows                of a bank and took computers and swivel chairs to make a                bonfire. It was in this mob that a young man was killed, the                back of his head torn away, nobody knew how.<p>                In the clinic inside the university the victims beganarriving. I                saw a man lying on a bloodstained table as a doctor in white                coat operated on his back with half-a-dozen spectators                eyeing his exposed bones. "It must have been live                ammunition. The bullet went right through his upper body,"                the doctor said.<p>                Staff treated 25 people for injuries from tear-gas and rubber                bullets. But the toll of casualties could be higher. At one or                two points on the eight-mile journey back to the city centre,                roads were blocked by milling crowds, and the occasional                crack of gunfire was ringing out. Even in the plush business                centre riot police faced angry crowds. Two shots rang out as                we passed. "That's a pistol," said the driver, like everyone                else in Jakarta now an expert on the sounds different                weapons make. <p><center><hr noshade><A HREF="http://www.electric.on.net"        onMouseOver="waxon('home');        statuson('home'); return true;"        onMouseOut="statusoff(); waxoff('home');        return true;"><IMG name=home SRC="../buttons/butt_home_off.gif" ALT="home" WIDTH="140" HEIGHT="32" BORDER="0"></a><A HREF="../essays/index.html"        onMouseOver="waxon('essays');        statuson('essays'); return true;"        onMouseOut="statusoff(); waxoff('essays');        return true;"><IMG name=essays SRC="../buttons/butt_essays_off.gif" ALT="essays" WIDTH="140" HEIGHT="32" BORDER="0"></a><hr noshade></center><p><A HREF="http://www.electric.on.net">http://www.electric.on.net</A><p>&copy; This work is subject to copyright.
