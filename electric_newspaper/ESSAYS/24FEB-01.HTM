Just as some ofus were once told that there is no Santa Claus, no Tooth Fairy, and no reasonto be silly, today we were told there was no such thing as a Secret Report.<p>	Quite a shock. <p>	You'll remember that a week ago today,  Premier John Olsen announced tohis own Liberal colleagues - who may nominally be expected to representtheir electors - and to the rest of us that he was putting $2 to $4 billiondollars of our property on the market.<p>	He had earlier been asked if he was going to do this.<p>	He said "no." <p>	That was during the election campaign, when to have answered "yes" wouldhave seen him kicked out of office. Big way.<p>	But he didn't say "yes". Not then. <p>	Last week, he not only said "Yes"; he also asked us to believe that hedidn't lie when he said "no".<p>	It is a good thing that we believe him. Otherwise we'd have to kick him out- not for selling ETSA, but for lying. Big way.<p>	Last Tuesday, Mr Olsen said he had no plans of selling ETSA and Optimauntil he received the Auditor-General's report in mid-December.<p>	It has now been revealed that the State's top government advisors,including ETSA itself, the Premier's chief executive officer, and theOffice of Energy Policy, as well as the Under-Treasurer, Gerald Bradley,had had the report since mid-1997.<p>	In a Parliament House committee room yesterday the urbane and unflappableAuditor-General, Mr Kenneth Ian  MacPherson, LLB, FCPA, was before theEconomic and Finance committee.<p>	Now Mr MacPherson is as straight as they come. His credentials areimpeccable. He is an independant officer of the Parliament, and even hiscritics concede he is scrupulously honest.<p>	Here's what he said in questioning from Labor's Trish White:<p>	MS WHITE: Are you saying that on 28 July the advisor to (Minister) GrahamIngerson was given a copy?<p>	MR MACPHERSON: Mr Longbottom.<p>	MS WHITE: Of your draft report?<p>	MR MACPHERSON: Yes, that is correct.<p>	MS WHITE: Anyone in Treasury?<p>	MR MACPHERSON: The copy went to the Under-Treasurer.<p>	MS WHITE: The Under-Treasurer?<p>	MR MACPHERSON: Yes.<p>	MS WHITE: So the Under-Treasurer plus Graham Ingerson's advisor had adraft copy of this report on 28 July?<p>	MR MACPHERSON: That is correct.<p>	MR FOLEY: Three months before an election when they said they wouldn'tsell it.<p>	South Australians are therefore being asked by the Premier to believe thatsome of the State's top public servants were given shock-horror details ofa potential loss of $1 billion, but declined to tell him or the Ministerfor Infrastructure.<p>	The Premier's department chief, Ian Kowlick, says this is exactly whathappened. He says this was due to "the fact that a State election was aboutto be called".<p>	We believe that. Don't we?<p>	But what about immediately after the election?<p>	According to what Mr Olsen said in Parliament seven days ago, he was notmade aware of the Auditor-General's report until mid-December, and it wasthen that he decided ETSA must be sold.<p>	If this is the case, then one would imagine a conversation like this inthe Premier's office immediately after the election.<p>	PREMIER: Good morning, Ian. Nice day. Hey, did you see in the papers thatI've won the election?<p>	MR KOWALICK: Oh, yeah, I think I read that. Congratulations.<p>	PREMIER: Well, we'll have to do lunch sometime. Meanwhile, is thereanything new?<p>	MR KOWALICK: Oh, a billion-dollar exposure thing on ETSA came up a fewmonths ago.<p>	PREMIER:  Tell me about it in mid-December, will you? <p>	Yes, that's plausible for sure. Far more plausible than the Premier beingtold either before the election, or immediately after.		<p>	Because it was a Secret Report, wasn't it?<p>	Because we still believe in Santa Claus, the Tooth Fairy, and not beingsilly.<p><hr noshade><p><A HREF="http://www.electric.on.net">http://www.electric.on.net</A><p>&copy; This work is subject to copyright.
