MrMcLachlan was a very high profile president of the National FarmersFederation, and established his anti-union credentials as the head of thatorganisation in some particularly bitter industrial confrontations with theAustralian Meat Industry Employees Union, both in South Australia andelsewhere.<p>It would be true to say that Ian McLachlan is amongst the driest of LiberalFederal MPs.<p>He has always favoured the complete phase-out of tariff protection forAustralia's automotive industry and for the textile and clothing andfootwear industry, not withstanding  the damage that would have done to hisown constituents working for Fletcher Jones in Mount Gambier.<p>Whilst in Mount Gambier with David Detchon, I had the opportunity ofmeeting a number of journalists and business people and other communityleaders, who all expressed their deep resentment towards Mr McLachlan. Heis clearly perceived to be totally out of touch with the average person, aswell as arrogant and high-handed in his dealings with them. This can beclearly demonstrated by the fact that even though his electorate of Barkercovers all of the south east of South Australia, his actual electorateoffice is on the 12th floor of the Commonwealth Bank Building in KingWilliam Street, Adelaide. As I said in an interview with the local media inMount Gambier, "Mr McLachlan needs a road map to find Mount Gambier."<p>There is talk of a One Nation candidate receiving considerable support inBarker. However, in my view Mr McLachlan is more at risk from otherIndependents such as Mr Tony Beck, a farmer in the electorate, then he maybe from One Nation. It is known that Mr Beck may be able to count on thesupport of State Liberal Independents, Rory McEwen and Mitch Williams, theMembers for Gordon and MacKillop respectively, whose electorates areentirely within the Federal Seat of Barker.<p>Mr McLachlan's arrogance has been highlighted by the fact that on a numberof occasions when there have been articles critical of him in the localBoarder Watch Newspaper, he has taken to telephoning the journalistconcerned, including junior journalists, and berating them for daring towrite articles which are critical of him.<p>On local ABC radio recently he also complained they were beginning to soundlike the Boarder Watch, in the news items they were carrying about hiseffectiveness as a local Member.<p>Mr McLachlan and the Liberal Party had the Seat of Barker with somethinglike a 20 per cent party preferred margin, and therefore it is highlyunlikely that Labor's candidate David Detchon, a 28 year-old lawnmowingcontractor from Goolwa, is going to wrest the Seat from him at thiselection. However, an astute political campaign by Labor in Barker, addingfuel to the fire around the perceptions that Mr McLachlan is an arrogant,aloof Federal Member, totally indifferent to the needs of the localelectorate could well assist an Independent in unseating him.<p>David Detchon is to be commended for the efforts that he is putting in tohis election campaign. It is well known the ALP has virtually no fundswithin the Barker electorate and the Party Office is not going to, as itsees, it waste money in a blue ribbon Liberal seat. Therefore he has torely on his own shoe leather and to campaing at his own expense, inforsaking his own time earning an income for himself and his young family(which includes four young children), to visit Mount Gambier and elsewhere,standing on streets and arcades in the main population centres handing outleaflets introducing himself to potential constituents.<p>On election night, Barker could well surprise political commentators. Ithas the same ingredients as that which existed in the electoral upset thatoccurred in the South East at the State election in October 1997, when thetwo Independent Liberal candidates for MacKillop and Gordon won on LaborParty preferences, in formerly rock solid safe State Liberal Seats.<p>From my perspective as a Labor MP and a former Trade Union official, Icertainly have no love for the ideology of Ian McLachlan. It would give mea great sense of vindication for any  "born-to-rule squatter" to be tossedout of the Federal Parliament by his own kind.<br clear=all><p><center><img src="http://www.electric.on.net/ads/ads_news/agriffiths_optometrist.gif" width=380 height=60 border=0></center><p><center><hr noshade><A HREF="http://www.electric.on.net"        onMouseOver="waxon('home');        statuson('home'); return true;"        onMouseOut="statusoff(); waxoff('home');        return true;"><IMG name=home SRC="../buttons/butt_home_off.gif" ALT="home" WIDTH="140" HEIGHT="32" BORDER="0"></a><A HREF="../essays/index.html"        onMouseOver="waxon('essays');        statuson('essays'); return true;"        onMouseOut="statusoff(); waxoff('essays');        return true;"><IMG name=essays SRC="../buttons/butt_essays_off.gif" ALT="essays" WIDTH="140" HEIGHT="32" BORDER="0"></a><hr noshade></center><p><A HREF="http://www.electric.on.net">http://www.electric.on.net</A><p>&copy; This work is subject to copyright.
