Theelectorate really wanted none of what was on offer. The Governmentpresented as hopelessly divided, bereft of talent and without ideas. TheOpposition was not warmly embraced as a realistic, preferred alternative.Polling figures show that the bulk of the increase in the ALP two-partypreferred vote came via minor party and independent preferences.<p>The Democrat vote rose to such an extent that the Democrat candidatesoutpolled major party candidates in many seats. There were very nearly anumber of Democrat members sitting in the House of Assembly. Two Democratsand one independent were among the eleven members elected to seats in theLegislative Council. Democrats such as Ian Gilfillan claimed that this wasa massive pro-Democrat vote. In reality, the huge rise in Democrat firstpreference votes had a lot more to do with an expression of frustration atthe incapacity of the major parties to tackle  problems actually facingSouth Australians. <p>The election predictably solved none of these real problems, nor did itbring a solutiion even one step closer. The sad realisation is dawning onSouth Australians that it is more than just a case of our political leadersnot being up to the job. Our present system of Government seems incapableof throwing up the leadership required.<p>Our Westminster model of Government was borrowed from England. It shouldnot surprise anyone that this model, developed over centuries to govern anEmpire upon which the sun never set, is not meeting our local needs in thetwilight years of the 20th century.    <p>South Australia is basically a city-state with a vast hinterland. Our Stateis not blessed by nature with great agricultural or mineral wealth. We lackfresh water. We enjoy no geographical advantage associated with being onthe way to somewhere important. Unless we do things a lot better than otherAustralians and people in other lands, we are doomed to fade and die as acommunity.<p>We require direction and leadership in order to tackle and overcome themassive impediments to our future prosperity.<p>Our present Constitutional arrangements encourage and entrench theinstability and weakness in our Government.<p>The xxecutive arm of Government so dominates the legislature that the onlycheck on excesses or stupidity comes from the judiciary and certainstatutory officers, such as the Auditor-General. The power of the executivehas corrupted the system to such an extent that the wishes of the peopleare ignored in substance all of the time and in form, at all but electiontimes.<p>The role of the Parliament as a protector of the people, willing and ableto take on the executive, has been turned on its head. The Parliament isnow little more than a bizarre private club. A club in which those whoyearn for executive office, hunt and attempt to destroy incumbents. In sodoing, they hope to prize the levers of executive power free for their ownuse. This predatory mentality dominates the Parliament to the exclusion ofits proper role as our watch-dog over the Executive.<p>The problem is particularly serious in South Australia where such a highproportion of Government members in both chambers already hold executiveoffice, whether as a Minister or a Parliamentary Secretary.<p>Ironic as it may seem, this also corrupts the proper functioning of theexecutive too. Recent history shows how a Premier, swept into office with arecord majority in the House of Assembly, can be destroyed by venalself-interest on the part of otherwise insignificant members of thegoverning party. This gives no confidence in the system.<p>The old objective of a Government of the people, by the people, for thepeople, has become a reality of Government of the people, by the powerful,for the powerful.<p>Things can not continue in this way. Already contempt for our system andour politicians has reached dangerous levels. The public is sodisillusioned that we almost expect corruption, lies and deceit fromParliamentarians.<p>The cure for this complex of symptoms requires radical constitutionalsurgery. The executive arm of Government must be separated totally from thelegislative arm. The executive should be directly elected by the people.The legislature should be directly elected as it currently is, but it mustbe impossible to hold both legislative and executive office at the same time.<p>This is hardly an untried, crazy idea. This is essentially the same systemthat operates in the American States and at the Federal level in the US.The governing party members in the Parliament would have their hands untiedfrom the responsibility of blindly supporting the Premier, for fear ofbringing down the Government. As it is now, they are under enormouspressure to support him, no matter how manifestly silly he may be.<p>The Premier, or in my preferred model, the elected Governor, would have asecure, fixed term in office. He could only be removed by impeachmentproceedings such as are presently available to remove judges. The Governorcould select whomsoever he wished to be in his executive team, the"Ministry" if you like. This ministry could be selected on the basis ofneed and the talent available throughout the community. Contrast this withthe present situation where the choice is limited to the tiny pool oftalent in the Parliament at any given time.<p>In practice, a candidate could stand for the position of Governor, with orwithout the support of the major political parties. Either way, we would begiven a chance to vote directly for our Governor for the next four years.<p>This reform would restore some faith in the political process and bring theexecutive closer to the people. The Governor would have a personal mandateto implement the policies upon which he was elected. The Parliament wouldbe free to keep a critical eye on the executive, without fear of destroyingthe Government by expressing a difference of opinion, or properlyscrutinising executive conduct.<p>Of course, no system of government has yet been devised which is immune toabuse or corruption. I am sure that my proposal would have its faults andweaknesses too. But surely the time has come to seriously overhaul ourpresent system. It is not working. This proposal would be a great leapforward.       <p><center><hr noshade><A HREF="http://www.electric.on.net"        onMouseOver="waxon('home');        statuson('home'); return true;"        onMouseOut="statusoff(); waxoff('home');        return true;"><IMG name=home SRC="../buttons/butt_home_off.gif" ALT="home" WIDTH="140" HEIGHT="32" BORDER="0"></a><A HREF="../essays/index.html"        onMouseOver="waxon('essays');        statuson('essays'); return true;"        onMouseOut="statusoff(); waxoff('essays');        return true;"><IMG name=essays SRC="../buttons/butt_essays_off.gif" ALT="essays" WIDTH="140" HEIGHT="32" BORDER="0"></a><hr noshade></center><p><A HREF="http://www.electric.on.net">http://www.electric.on.net</A><p>&copy; This work is subject to copyright.
