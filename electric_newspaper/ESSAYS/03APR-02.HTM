But in many ways our lives have beenimproved and sometimes, perhaps to people’s surprise, laws passed byParliament have helped make that happen.  <p>	Take, for example, deaths on South Australian roads.  In 1970 there were349 deaths on South Australian roads.  Our population in that year was just1.16 million.  However last year only 149 people were killed on SouthAustralian roads, 200 less than 27 years earlier.  In that period ourpopulation has increased by nearly 30% to about 1.5 million.  <p>	What are the reasons for this dramatic reduction in road deaths?  Firstly,car design has improved the safety of the vehicles in which we travel.Secondly, legislation in 1971 which made the wearing of seat beltscompulsory, is now well accepted by the community.  Thirdly, random breathtesting has had a significant role in minimising drink driving,particularly amongst the young.  <p>	Initially there were many opponents to seat belt legislation.  I rememberone woman who threatened to chain herself to a stobie pole because thislegislation would eliminate her freedom of choice.  But there has beenoverwhelming evidence that the wearing of seat belts significantly reducesthe possibility of death and/or serious injuries to both drivers andpassengers.  A recent example was the tragic death of Princess Diana.Several experts were of the strong view that she could have survived theaccident in Paris had she been wearing a seat belt.  <p>	When random breath test legislation was first proposed in South Australiain the early 1980's, it created a furore in sections of the media and theliquor and hospitality industries.  The News, Adelaide's afternoonnewspaper at the time, ran an eight page venomous attack on thislegislation.  Of course it had nothing to do with the drinking habits ofthe journalists at the paper!  <p>	I was a member of the two select committees of the Legislative Councilwhich examined random breath testing (RBT).  The statistics were bothcompelling and frightening.  Roughly half the deaths on South Australianroads at that time were due to drink driving.  And about half the peoplekilled as a result of drink driving were innocent victims.  <p>	The first select committee inspected RBT in Victoria, which had been apioneer in world terms in introducing testing in 1976.  On a wet and mistynight near Moonee Valley we watched the RBT unit in operation.  The gnarledsergeant who had been with the unit since it had been established,recounted many amusing moments.  On one occasion they were packing up forthe night when a car sped past the RBT caravan, which was lit up like aChristmas tree, at around 100 kilometres per hour, well in excess of thespeed limit.  They heard a screech of brakes and the car dangerouslyreversed up the highway to the caravan.  The driver staggered out andapproached the caravan.  He slurred, "A chest X-ray unit!  What a bloodygood idea!  About time I had one of those."  They duly did give him one ofthose, but it wasn't an X-ray and he blew 0.18 and was charged!  <p>	The South Australian Parliament quickly appreciated the benefits of RBTlaws and introduced further legislation requiring first time drivers tohave a zero blood alcohol content.  There has been a dramatic reduction inthe number of deaths, injuries and accidents among young drivers as aresult of this law.  <p>	Random breath testing is not about catching people, so much as changingperceptions and attitudes towards drink driving.  If you drink, don't driveand you'll stay alive.  <p>	So sometimes politicians do have the satisfaction of seeing legislationwhich they have supported, working to the benefit of a community whichoften had been initially sceptical or hostile.<p><center><hr noshade><A HREF="http://www.electric.on.net"        onMouseOver="waxon('home');        statuson('home'); return true;"        onMouseOut="statusoff(); waxoff('home');        return true;"><IMG name=home SRC="../buttons/butt_home_off.gif" ALT="home" WIDTH="140" HEIGHT="32" BORDER="0"></a><A HREF="../essays/index.html"        onMouseOver="waxon('essays');        statuson('essays'); return true;"        onMouseOut="statusoff(); waxoff('essays');        return true;"><IMG name=essays SRC="../buttons/butt_essays_off.gif" ALT="essays" WIDTH="140" HEIGHT="32" BORDER="0"></a><hr noshade></center><p><A HREF="http://www.electric.on.net">http://www.electric.on.net</A><p>&copy; This work is subject to copyright.
