H. de Bree, a student and teacher at Utrecht University in the Netherlands<p><IMG SRC="../illustrations/03Feb1998.gif" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="300" HEIGHT="230" BORDER="0">The best way to give some insight into the Dutch tertiary education system might be to compare it to a battered, worn-out bus. 	This vehicle of education is too old to be used, but still mechanics keep on slaving over it, opening the bonnet time and again, removing useful parts and not repairing anything at all. The mobile's framework, the structure of the system, is the rusty part but no changes are made to that. Government mechanics cannot see the rottenness of the overall structure. 	After six years of secondary education in the Netherlands, the road to tertiary education is then open. Students can get in the bus for a ride of at least four years. In these four years students have to acquire a certain number of credit points in one field of study in order to obtain their Masters. However, more and more students are not trying to catch this bus, because it provides neither a comfortable trip nor a good destination. 	 With the current Minister of Education, Culture, and Science, as the driver, students fully realize that they are lucky to get out alive. 	Most students are convinced that this Minister, Mr Ritzen, never obtained his driving license. At least, Ritzen has not demonstrated any skills driving the tertiary education system these past few years. 	Ritzen is convinced that students can graduate in four, if not three years, and have a permanent, part-time job to pay for the exorbitant bus fares. In other words, grants are plummeting while the demand for good results is rising. Five years ago, a regular student living at home received a grant of 400 guilders a month (A$(*&^(&^) for six years. Today, that same student would receive just a quarter of that, and the term of the grant has been reduced to a maximum of four years. And grants are still diminishing.<p>This grant does not even cover the tuition fee, which is 2575 now (compared to 2400 two years ago) and still going up. 	Students are becoming reluctant to get into the vehicle, because this meagre grant is turned into an enormous loan to the State if a student does not earn enough study credits in any one year. Even talented students might not be able to pay the required bus fares and end up missing the bus altogether.<p>Even though it is comparatively easy to borrow money from the State, this is precarious since interest rates are fierce and deadly. A bus ride like this leaves many passengers with a bitter taste, especially when unemployment seems to be a more and more likely after graduation. 	Ritzen is not the only one to blame for the students' grumbling, because the Government has made his Department the focus of budget cuts. Like Amanda Vanstone in Australia, Ritzen himself seems keen to point out where these cuts can be made.<p>However, the engine block is almost empty and parts are removed from the wrong places. A bus needs four wheels and an engine at least to be able to work. Similarly, students need to have the opportunity to try university education. Ritzen's Party, the Social-Democratic PVDA, still maintains publicly that university is open to everybody, but most students are convinced that selection on wealth is an obstruction to the education system.<p>Meanwhile the bus company, or the association of Dutch universities, is very worried about these budget cuts and lower entry rates, fearing universities might just go broke when nobody wants to use the bus anymore. 	One huge problem is that the firm does not have the permission to design an automobile that will perfectly suit both students and universities. A solution has to be found within the shaky bus framework and the only possible way to keep the customers from continually grumbling is to make the bus more attractive to potential students. 	Unfortunately, the company cannot decrease fees because maintenance of the bus requires money. So instead the company gives the bus a new colour and adds unnecessary luxury in the bus. In other words, the level of education is adapted for the less motivated or talented students. This certainly seems to satisfy both the majority of the customers and the provider, but others argue that students are able to obtain a degree without really having discovered whether science, for example, is where their talent lies, and the university meanwhile receives a bonus for every university degree it awards.<p>The Netherlands has made a grave mistake. Gifted potential students with little money or assets have to wait at the bus stop as less talented but wealthier people take university places. 	After having survived four years in the rambling vehicle, students are dumped and have to find their way in the world by waving their newly obtained diploma. Very few students can get another two to four years' grant to obtain their PhD. Many first-class researchers miss the bus. The now-limited nature of Dutch research, which was once a beacon in Western Europe, makes its science graduates unattractive to foreign employers. The Netherlands is putting itself in an academically unfavourable position. 	As in Australia, the Dutch Government ironically comprises people who had the opportunity to study for years on end with grants that today's students cannot even imagine. Increasingly, many Dutch now feel that their Government has to face the fact that the bus must be towed to the scrapyard and a new vehicle made. This new vehicle could be driven by universities themselves. Fees would then not be dependent on Government's decisions, budget cuts might be minimised, and the quality of education might rise again. Until then, students who can find the means will have to take a ride in a rambling automobile.<p>Still, the realistic assessment of Dutch tertiary education in the short term is that today's students might be better off than the students of the future. If the current trend continues, future students will probably think of today's study possibilities are luxurious. The Netherlands has not reached the absolute nadir in education.
