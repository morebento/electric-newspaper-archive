Commentators picked up thisimagery and ran with it. Specific proposals were "on the cart", or "off thecart". At the climax of the Tax Reform Summit, "the wheels fell off thecart" altogether. Keating's preferred position, "Option C", was dumped.<p>The key element of "Option C", was a broadly based goods and services tax.In other words, a GST. The Liberals opposed "Option C" for reasons ofpolitical expediency. Business also opposed a GST, as did the welfare lobbyand the ACTU. It was the GST that bogged the Tax  Cart's wheels andeventually, tore them off.<p>In 1992, Dr Hewson put a new Tax Cart on the road. This time Paul Keatingopposed the GST. The one clear thing about the 1993 General Election, isthat it was a referendum on the GST. It was overwhelmingly rejected. Moreoverwhelming, when one considers how hated Paul Keating was.<p>Dr Hewson was destroyed. John Howard eventually rose from the Liberalashes. To put a definite end to the lingering ghost of 1993, Mr Howardpromised that the GST was dead, for good. So much for that promise. Within18 months of being elected, Mr Howard and Mr Costello were busy talking up"Tax Reform" and putting the wheels back on the GST Cart.<p>Isn't it funny that this GST proposal keeps coming back like a bad penny. <p>Governments like the GST because it promises untold revenue to theTreasury. The money comes from sources that won't disturb the filthy richwho now pay little or no tax. These rich people are hard to take on. Theyfight back. They employ smart lawyers and accountants. They seem able toinfluence Public Opinion. A lazy gutless Government finds it much easier totax rent money paid by pensioners. Much easier to tax food and school fees.Much easier to turn every small business in Australia into an unpaidoutpost of the Australian Tax Office.<p>Governments also like the GST because once it is introduced, it can beincreased, little by little. It is the ultimate weapon of lazy Government.Its impact is greatest on the ordinary citizen, the little people who lackthe information and resources to fight back. Meanwhile, the spotlight comesoff the big dodgers of income and corporate tax. If we vote for a GST, weare admitting that it is just too hard to tax the rich and the powerful. Wewill be inviting them to please themselves even more. Only a fool wouldbelieve that any Government would chase these big fish when it has the easyoption of taxing defenceless small fry instead.<p>The Tax Department loves the idea too. It amounts to the "contracting out"of tax collection to over one million small traders. The best bit is thatthese people won't be paid for their endless hours filling in endlessforms. They will just face criminal prosecution if they fail to collect thetax. This virtually amounts to civil conscription of small business.<p>What Government would you trust with a new tax that they can increase atwill? You would have to be a moron to believe Mr Howard's promise that therate of tax will "never "go up. Even if he keeps his word, (which recenthistory shows is unlikely), he won't be Prime Minister in five years.<p>This GST proposal is a con-job. The easy money from a GST would come frompensioners, families and the least well off. They would pay  new taxes onessentials. Meanwhile, the lazy rich would be let off the hook. A GST isnot good policy, it is a substitute for it. A GST would submerge smallbusiness in paperwork and expose it to new criminal penalties.<p>The distant rumble of the GST Cart is growing louder. It will be given anew name, but it remains what it has always been. Bad policy for ordinaryAustralians. All of us have a part to play in making sure the wheels falloff GST Cart this time too.   <p><font size=-1>* John Rau is an Adelaide barrister and commentator on social, legal, andeconomic affairs.
