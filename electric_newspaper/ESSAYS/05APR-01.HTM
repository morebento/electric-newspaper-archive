And E-ducation, too.</font></B><br><font size=-1>by Nicole de Bree, in York, U.K.</font><p>	Last week, Australian university students took to the streets of all yourcapital cities to protest against your seemingly fierce cuts to education. <p>	You're not alone. All over western Europe, the debate about how to run aschool system and a university system, and how to pay for it, is ragingsimultaneously with Australia. Perhaps there are lessons for both of us here.<p>	Your readers might remember (if not, it's still in your paper in the AllViewpoints section)  E.H. de Bree's article about tertiary education in theNetherlands - or Western Europe for that matter. As a student at a Britishuniversity, I am becoming aware of the universality of limitations ofuniversity education. <p>	The relevance to Australian readers is twofold. Firstly they can have agood laugh about the mess those colonising (and often patronising) bastardsin Western Europe are in. Secondly, they can learn a little something from those mistakes, and perhaps benefit.   <p>	One of the problems the West faces is costs. Every country in WesternEuropean has and is continuing to drastically cut education spending, eventhough in Germany for example  (the country with the largest studentpopulation on a per capita basis) all a student has to pay is an averageyearly administration fee of DM 65 (approx. As$ 80). All over WesternEurope (if not beyond) people are becoming aware of the need of changes inthe education system, but their approaches and attitudes towards it vary. <p>	In the Netherlands, the educational system is compared to a dilapidatedbus that ought not to be on the road anymore. In Britain, however, thesystem is considered traditional and for that sole reason worthy ofmaintenance, regardless of costs.<p>	In Britain, a tuition fee of up to £1000 per year of university educationwill be introduced from next year. A major difference between TheNetherlands and Britain seems to be, however, that students will only haveto pay these fees AFTER they have graduated, and not even 10% of thestudents will have to pay the full £1000, as it is a means-tested fee. <p>	What this comes down to in reality is that those who will be paying thefull fee are those people who gladly pay £2000 a TERM for their children'ssecondary education at public schools.  <p>	Public protests concerning the introduction of these fees are largelyunfounded. It is not true that university education will only be possiblefor the rich, because there are other selection criteria that decidewhether or not students will be accepted at university. This is not thecase in (Germany and) the Netherlands, where student numbers areridiculously high, and where selection on the basis of income COULD be amuch more realistic threat.<p>	The British also fail to recognise that students cannot receive theireducation for free, as another reader's response to Ms de Bree's articlerightfully pointed out. Facilities for British university students are muchbetter than those of, for example, Dutch students, who have been paying fortheir education for quite some time.<p>	Another question facing universities, their students, and governments isto define a university's position in the world - is it purely a researchinstitute or does it need to be linked to the job market? At present,universities are trying to be both, arguing that the need for large numbersof students (i.e. more funding!) and sponsorship from industry interfereswith the 'strictly research' climate. <p>	What this means, though, is that humanities and arts studies, thetraditional university disciplines, receive the smallest amount of moneyavailable, as they are the areas of study that are considered leastrelevant to modern society. It therefore becomes very unattractive to studyhuman sciences,  and to focus instead on studies that will get you rich -or maybe will just get you a job. <p>	I don't think there is any reason to presume that the situation is anydifferent in Australia. Needless to say that as an Arts students (withoutblinkers!) I believe that this is a dangerous development, as theyconcentrate on people and their position IN the modern world.<p>	But now, at last, I arrive at the core of my epistle. The point I ammaking is that if Australia looks to Western Europe to redefine itstertiary education structure, it should try to prevent making mistakes thathave been made over and over again. It should not be afraid of changing itsstructure radically, should that be necessary.  <p>	The Australian Government should not be afraid of imposing qualityrestrictions on the students they let in, because student numbers will thenbe checked in a fair way. If student numbers are reasonable, that meansthat the amount of money necessary for their education and the maintenanceof universities will be kept in check, and general costs for the studentswill be lower as well. <p>	It could also mean that an even distribution of money along the severaldisciplines would be possible again, and with that a reasonable attitudetowards the humanities. The government could provide and PROMOTE otherforms of education for those students who simply want practical training. <p>	In order to pay for all of this one-time, big but worthwhile investment,the Australian Government would not have to be afraid of imposingmeans-tested tuition fees that do take into account the 'raw material'aspect of students, as your another reader pointed out. It could allow manyvisiting students to study at its universities. The scientific disciplinescould sell their research findings if they are useful for  industrialpurposes.<p>	In short, I am projecting all my frustrations about failures and mistakesof western European tertiary education in the hope that Australia, as arelatively young nation, may not be as stuck in its ways as we are.Although it has probably already constructed its university 'bus', it mightnot be too late to change some of its essential parts BEFORE embarking on along journey.<p><center><hr noshade><A HREF="http://www.electric.on.net"        onMouseOver="waxon('home');        statuson('home'); return true;"        onMouseOut="statusoff(); waxoff('home');        return true;"><IMG name=home SRC="../buttons/butt_home_off.gif" ALT="home" WIDTH="140" HEIGHT="32" BORDER="0"></a><A HREF="../essays/index.html"        onMouseOver="waxon('essays');        statuson('essays'); return true;"        onMouseOut="statusoff(); waxoff('essays');        return true;"><IMG name=essays SRC="../buttons/butt_essays_off.gif" ALT="essays" WIDTH="140" HEIGHT="32" BORDER="0"></a><hr noshade></center><p><A HREF="http://www.electric.on.net">http://www.electric.on.net</A><p>&copy; This work is subject to copyright.
