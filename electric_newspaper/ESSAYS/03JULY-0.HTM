Isn't it scary listening to a richAmericans tell you they know what's best for you? <p>To add insult to injury we had the spectacle of the hired guns waving a wadof notes under the noses of the gathered journalists. I guess thatrepresents the money they hope to ship out of the country.<p>I wonder if those other highly paid consultants, the odd couple, GeoffAnderson and Alex Kennedy had a hand in this little piece of nonsense. Badcall.<p>When I announced that the Democrats wouldn't be supporting the sale of ourelectricity utilities I was warned to anticipate a campaign of hysteria anddeception. The warning was prescient.<p>The editorial of the Advertiser kicked things off the next day. Acombination of scorn and abuse was deemed to be a substitute for argument.<p>The Premier chipped in on morning radio. He told the listeners that ourelectricity utilities would be swamped in the National Electricity Market.To prove the point he said that the majority of our electricity isgenerated interstate (!) and hence Optima would never be able to compete.<p>This is simply wrong but the Premier obviously has no intention of lettingthe facts get in the way of a good scare campaign.<p>The problem for the Government is that the scare campaign isn't working. My office has been inundated with expressions of support. ‘Don't let thembully you' has been an oft-heard sentiment. <p>By Monday afternoon the Government had produced a counter argument to myreport on the proposed privatisation of ETSA and Optima. It is asunconvincing as all the arguments it has so far mounted to support the casefor sale.<p>At the same time the Premier issued a list of 15 rhetorical questions anddemanded they be answered ‘immediately'. The Premier seems to be deludedinto imagining he can snap his fingers and others will jump.<p>The Government's misinformation campaign continued with promises thatcountry consumers would pay no more than 1.7% above the city price forelectricity. The Premier failed to indicate there would be a time limit onthis. News leaked out that this was in fact a transitional arrangement andthat within five to ten years country consumers would be left to absorb thefull costs of transmitting electricity to the door.<p>Then on Wednesday the Treasurer misquoted an article I had previouslycontributed to this very journal. Not satisfied with attempting to misleadthe Parliament about what I had actually said he then repeated the stunt ina media release. It was an extraordinarily limp performance from one of theGovernment's better operators.<p>All of this is indicative of how desperate the Government is about theproposed privatisation of ETSA and Optima. How did they ever get themselvesinto such a mess?<p>I have a theory.<p>Having suffered inexcusable losses at the last state election the Premierdesperately needed to make a stand to reinforce his shaky hold on theLiberal leadership. Selling the power utilities was the obvious choice. <p>The Premier is clearly a true believer in economic rationalism. Furthermorethe injection of funds would allow the Government to point to a substantialreduction in State debt and provide a war chest for the next election.<p>The major problem for the Government was that it had categorically ruledout privatising ETSA and Optima during the recent State election. Giventhat the Democrats and Labor also opposed privatisation the Governmentfaced the real possibility of being defeated on the floor of the Parliament.<p>No problems, the Government had an escape hatch; a long term lease on theutilities. That would circumvent the need for Parliamentary approval andallow the Premier to look like the strong leader of his dreams. <p>Alas, like Liberal voters at the last election the Government was mislead.Later it emerged that the lease option would result in approximately a 20%discount on the expected sale price. I doubt whether even John Olsen wouldbe desperate enough to sell South Australia that short. <p>After our investigation exposed the Government's shoddy reckoning on thereasons for and benefits of sale the Government, caught in its own trap,turned nasty. <br clear=all><p><center><img src="http://www.electric.on.net/ads/ads_news/agriffiths_optometrist.gif" width=380 height=60 border=0></center><p><center><hr noshade><A HREF="http://www.electric.on.net"        onMouseOver="waxon('home');        statuson('home'); return true;"        onMouseOut="statusoff(); waxoff('home');        return true;"><IMG name=home SRC="../buttons/butt_home_off.gif" ALT="home" WIDTH="140" HEIGHT="32" BORDER="0"></a><A HREF="../essays/index.html"        onMouseOver="waxon('essays');        statuson('essays'); return true;"        onMouseOut="statusoff(); waxoff('essays');        return true;"><IMG name=essays SRC="../buttons/butt_essays_off.gif" ALT="essays" WIDTH="140" HEIGHT="32" BORDER="0"></a><hr noshade></center><p><A HREF="http://www.electric.on.net">http://www.electric.on.net</A><p>&copy; This work is subject to copyright.
