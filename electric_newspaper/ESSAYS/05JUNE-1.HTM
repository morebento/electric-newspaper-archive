This was the phrase which JohnBannon, as Leader of the Opposition, had been proud to call his own when hevehemently opposed the development of Roxby Downs in 1982.  The Hooglandarticle also paraded some ideological and inaccurate claptrap abouturanium, which totally ignored the facts.  <p>Seventy-five percent of revenue from Olympic Dam is derived from copper, 5%from gold and silver and only 20% from uranium.  Mr Hoogland claimed therewere only 946 direct jobs relating to production in Roxby Downs, well belowthe forecast 2,200 or more jobs.  Mr Hoogland neglects to mention theaccepted industry multiplier effect of 3 to 1 means there are another2,000-3,000 people in the wider community employed as a result of OlympicDam.  He also fails to mention 2,000 people were employed in the first $800million construction of Olympic Dam (1986-88) and that more than 2,500 jobshave been created during the current $1.64 billion expansion programme,with even more jobs flowing from the multiplier effect.  <p>Mr Hoogland laments that the value of production estimated over 15 yearsago at $1,200 million reached "only $350 million" by 1997.  Does he reallyexpect a mine to crank up to full capacity from day one?  The company'scurrent environmental impact statement provides an approval to produce350,000 tonnes per year of copper, which will result in the value ofproduction he is talking about.  Presumably if that target is reached, hewill claim the mine is too big!<p>WMC is currently paying the State Government about $12 million per year inroyalties and when the current expansion is completed in 1999, royaltypayments will increase by the same ratio as the extra products produced.<p>The Olympic Dam legislation passed Parliament only through the bravery ofLabor defector, Norm Foster.  It required the State Government to spend $50million on public infrastructure.  This amount has not quite been spent butthe State has already received back over $60 million in royalties, morethan it has paid out in infrastructure spending. <p>There will be long lasting benefits to South Australia from Olympic Dam.Mr Hoogland doesn't want to spoil his story so he does not mention the orebody at Olympic Dam consists of more than 560 million tonnes of ore, whichwill provide 60 100 years of mining life, even at the expanded rate ofproduction.  Further exploration seems certain to dramatically increase theeconomic life of one of the world's great underground mines.  <p>Mr Hoogland ignores the other significant economic and intangible benefitswhich have flowed from this project.  For example, 80% of the current $1.64billion expansion programme is being spent in South Australia.  At PortAugusta and Whyalla pre-assembly facilities have been established by WMC,which employ 240 locals to prefabricate items for the Olympic Dam expansion.  <p>Anyone who has visited Roxby Downs (does that include Mr Hoogland?) couldnot fail to be impressed by WMC's commitment to the environment.  There hasbeen an enormous amount of environmental knowledge of arid Australia gainedby its committed environmental team.  This has been recognised withnational environmental awards.  <p>The design of Roxby Downs, its housing and public amenities, have beenwidely applauded by town planners.  Roxby Downs has won two consecutiveTidy Towns awards and when the current expansion phase is complete, it isexpected to boast a population of close to 4,000.  <p>Recently, publicity was given to the fact that the annual income per capitaat Roxby Downs was the highest of any town or suburb in South Australia andone of the highest in Australia.  <p>Mr Hoogland apparently lives and works in South Australia.  SouthAustralians have been fed with a diet of negative news in recent years,much of it stemming from the massive $4 billion of losses racked up by theBannon Labor Government through State Bank, SGIC, and Scrimber.  Justremember the Labor Government's memorable quinella - Labor was againstRoxby Downs and ignored the Liberal Party's warnings over two years aboutproblems at the State Bank.<p>It's a bit rich when Mr Hoogland shafts a mining venture which isinternationally acclaimed and bills Roxby as a bad news story.  From JohnBannon's mirage in the desert 15 years ago, to a population of 4,000 andmassive export income for South Australia, should score at least 8 out of10 with most unbiased observers.  So, if Roxby Downs is bad news for MrHoogland, he will be positively frothing with adjectives when describingthe State Bank, SGIC and Scrimber losses.  I look forward to HappyHoogland's contribution on this subject in the coming weeks.<br clear=all><p><center><img src="http://www.electric.on.net/ads/ads_news/agriffiths_optometrist.gif" width=380 height=60 border=0></center><p><center><hr noshade><A HREF="http://www.electric.on.net"        onMouseOver="waxon('home');        statuson('home'); return true;"        onMouseOut="statusoff(); waxoff('home');        return true;"><IMG name=home SRC="../buttons/butt_home_off.gif" ALT="home" WIDTH="140" HEIGHT="32" BORDER="0"></a><A HREF="../essays/index.html"        onMouseOver="waxon('essays');        statuson('essays'); return true;"        onMouseOut="statusoff(); waxoff('essays');        return true;"><IMG name=essays SRC="../buttons/butt_essays_off.gif" ALT="essays" WIDTH="140" HEIGHT="32" BORDER="0"></a><hr noshade></center><p><A HREF="http://www.electric.on.net">http://www.electric.on.net</A><p>&copy; This work is subject to copyright.
