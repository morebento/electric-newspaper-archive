It would seem that this philosophy is still alive andwell in South Australia.<p>	Before the State Election, the Premier swore black and blue that he wouldnot, under any circumstances, be selling ETSA. The Premier knew full wellthat most South Australians detested his decision, taken withoutconsultation, to sell SouthAustralia’s water management assets to SA Water. He knew that if he went totheelection advocating a sale of ETSA he would be wiped out. He went into theelectionpromising to do what the overwhelming bulk of the South Australiancommunity want and expect him to do - keep ETSA in South Australian hands. <p>	To say that the Government’s decision to sell ETSA is contemptible stillfails to adequately express the level of community outrage. If theGovernment thought it was reasonable to go to the people a few months agopromising not to sell ETSA, it should have the decency to stick to thisfundamental promise. If they have now changed their minds, they should havethe decency to immediately call an election and put their proposal to sellETSA to the people. Let the people of South Australia decide whether theywant to have ETSA sold.<p>	The Premier will not of course do this because he does not have the guts.<p>	 He knows that if he fought an election on the sale of ETSA now he wouldbe thrashed.<p>	It is comforting to know that certain American based utility companies arealready interested in buying ETSA. It gives me a warm and fuzzy feeling toimagine that one day decisions about my power supply will be made in someboardroom in Dallas instead of at the top of Anzac Highway.<p>	It makes me feel good to think that American utilities entrepreneurs willbe deciding the pricing of electricity supplies for South Australianindustries. I am  particularly pleased that South Australian pensioners andconcession holders will be able to benefit from the well known charitablebehaviour of international energycompanies.<p>	The Government has of course promised that no concession holders orcountry residents will in any way be disadvantaged. Imagine that. TheGovernment that promised only a few months ago prior to the election thatit would never sell ETSA, is now promising that when it does sell ETSA,certain disadvantaged people will not suffer. <p>	They have got to be joking. Even the most gullible South Australians havenow woken up to them.<p>	Not content with throwing ETSA onto the bonfire, the Government has alsodecided that it will sell the TAB and Lotteries Commission. There was anargument at one time to the effect that the Government involving itself ingambling was, to some extent, taking gambling out of the back rooms ofpubs. There is probably some truth in this argument.<p>	The fact is, though, that the Government stepped in to the role of SPbookmakers.The compensating factor was that the profits were to be directedback into public assets such as hospitals and schools.  <p>	This made it tolerable. What is now proposed is of course to sell thislicence to print money to priivate enterprise. In other words,entrepreneurial gambling licensed by the Government. <p>	The people of South Australia do have some prospect of getting rid of thistype of Government behaviour. The Government depends for its numbers in theHouse of Assembly upon a two Independents. People throughout SouthAustralia could make an effort to contact these Independents and urge themto bring down this Government. <p>	The people of South Australia deserve an opportunity to cast a vote at ageneral State Election before vital State assets such as ETSA are sold offto foreign utility companies.<p>	The call should go out now. We want an election and we want one now.<p><hr noshade><p><A HREF="http://www.electric.on.net">http://www.electric.on.net</A><p>&copy; This work is subject to copyright.
