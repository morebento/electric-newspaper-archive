I was driven balmy day after day as Dennis arrived homebragging about his gang's exploits. It was a steady menu of what the ganghad done, what it was going to do and how great Warwick was.<p>Dennis' loyalty was only broken when Warwick's family left town. While itwas going on, I didn't understand just how important this was to my brotherand the other members of Warwick's gang. We girls didn't have the samestructures.<p>In my teens I started going to the football with my father. Those Saturdayafternoons helped me gain a better understanding of modern tribalism. Joyand disappointment were shared experiences based on team loyalty. Winningcame first and unfair play, dodgy umpiring decisions and dumb luck meantlittle unless you were on the losing team.<p>Taking up politics and entering Parliament has completed my education inmodern tribalism. It is rampant in the large grey building on NorthTerrace. Members openly boast of their tribal loyalty.<p>Ralph Clarke, the Labor Member for Ross Smith, recently placed hiscommitment to tribalism on the public record:<p>"We in the Labor Party have great tribal loyalty. We might like to club oneanother occasionally, but what those in the Liberal Party do not understandis that we enjoy clubbing Liberals more than we enjoy clubbing ourselves -unlike members of the Liberal Party, who enjoy clubbing themselves morethan clubbing members of the Labor Party."<p>Ralph is a little ingenuous here. Inter-party rivalries are particularlyvicious within both of the old parties and great pleasure is taken in thefall of a factional rival in either the ALP or Liberals, as he well knows. <p>Some ALP members couldn't contain their glee at the fall of the oncepowerful centre-left faction. I also remember reports of a notably jollygathering in Dale Baker's office the night Dean Brown's premiership wassacrificed to John Olsen's leadership ambitions. I'm reminded of WinstonChurchill's quip that in Parliament the Opposition is in front of you, yourenemies are behind you. <p>That said, the main game is inflicting damage on the Opposition. Converselythe most effective means of limiting damage is by presenting a unifiedfront in the face of political adversity. Both parties practise thisprinciple as evidenced in the recent storm as to whether the former DeputyPremier and Minister for Industry, Trade and Tourism, Graham Ingerson, hadmisled the Parliament.<p>The brouhaha began when the Opposition lured the Minister into a statementthat was ultimately exposed as false. The Opposition in concert with theIndependents then forced an historic Privileges Committee to investigatethe claims. The Committee was comprised of two Government members, twoOpposition members and an Independent, Rory McEwen.<p>The Committee found unanimously the Minister had misled the House. On the crucial question of whether he had deliberately misled the House thecommittee split along party lines. The deadlock was broken by Rory McEwensupporting the Opposition members finding that the Minister's words weredeliberately misleading. <p>In the face of a majority finding the Minister had deliberately misled theHouse the Government's dilemma was acute. Stand by the Minister andsanction dismal parliamentary and ministerial standards or force theMinister to resign and fracture party unity. Tribal unity was preferredover parliamentary standards and a decision was made to stand by the Minister.<p>Not all Liberal members found this easy. One Liberal member, Steve Condous,told the media "I have my principles, I live by those principles and Ivalue them very much." He then bowed to the tribal bonds by acknowledginghe'd vote with the party whether "he believed in it or not".<p>Another Liberal member, Peter Lewis, actually broke ranks and voted for theno confidence motion in the Minister. At that moment Peter Lewis torehimself free of the chains of tribal loyalty. <p>To my mind his act was the most significant of any member of the Assembly.Even more so than Rory McEwen's ‘backflip'. I suspect Peter Lewis will paya heavy price. I respect his commitment to principle.<br clear=all><p><center><img src="http://www.electric.on.net/ads/ads_news/agriffiths_optometrist.gif" width=380 height=60 border=0></center><p><center><hr noshade><A HREF="http://www.electric.on.net"        onMouseOver="waxon('home');        statuson('home'); return true;"        onMouseOut="statusoff(); waxoff('home');        return true;"><IMG name=home SRC="../buttons/butt_home_off.gif" ALT="home" WIDTH="140" HEIGHT="32" BORDER="0"></a><A HREF="../essays/index.html"        onMouseOver="waxon('essays');        statuson('essays'); return true;"        onMouseOut="statusoff(); waxoff('essays');        return true;"><IMG name=essays SRC="../buttons/butt_essays_off.gif" ALT="essays" WIDTH="140" HEIGHT="32" BORDER="0"></a><hr noshade></center><p><A HREF="http://www.electric.on.net">http://www.electric.on.net</A><p>&copy; This work is subject to copyright.
