It is also fairto remind people that Ms Kernot was at great pains to lambast the ALP andthe Coalition for sneering at the Democrats for holding to their corevalues. That she finds herself in a different ideological context is now amatter for Ms Kernot and her apologists.<p>Economic rationalism has been embraced with equal fervour by both theCoalition and the ALP. No amount of rewriting of history can change thatand, frankly, it beggars belief that Ms Kernot will be able tosingle-handedly inoculate an organisation like the ALP against the ravagesof an electorate which has finally had enough of economic rationalism.<p>I  have been around the Democrat camp for some months now and in my view MsKernot is the Kim Philby of contemporary Australian politics. Almost everyutterance of hers and every strategic move by the ALP indicates that, afterher defection, she was and remains a willing participant in a very thoroughdebriefing process. <p>Recently there has been a spate of articles that indicate that Ms Kernot'smedia minders are cranking up again. Mr McKenzie Wark's recent contributionto the Australian (She who must be obeyed  1/7/98) is a case in point. <p>The attempt to hijack the recent work done by the Democrats in developing acredible and achievable strategy to counter the threat of One Nation in theSenate is patently obvious and rests on the very dubious proposition thatthe choice for the electorate is between Hanson and Kernot. <p>There are a number of problems with this theory. In the first place, topropose that the entire Australian electorate will orbit around either theMember for Oxley or an as yet unelected ALP candidate in a marginalQueensland seat implies a lack of the most elementary political knowledgeon the part of the electorate at large. Politicians who have traded on thissupposition in the past have had their careers cut very short.<p>Secondly, the proposition assumes that, even if elected, Ms Kernot will bein a position to have a significant influence on national affairs. She hasto be elected in the seat of Dickson, the ALP has to win government and shehas to be appointed to the Ministry. <p>In the event of this happy conjunction, Ms Kernot still faces a degree ofhostility and resentment from within the rank and file of her new Partybefore she can start to wield anywhere near the sort of political cloutthat has fallen into One Nation's lap. We know that the ALP is a verytribal, ‘blokey' organisation and an ALP powerbroker remarked recently,with reference to Ms Kernot:  "If they rat on ya once, they'll rat on yatwice." <p>It is onto this sea of suspicion that Ms Kernot hopes to relaunch herpolitical career and set sail for the Prime Minister's office. If the ALPremains true to form, she faces very heavy weather. The storm clouds towereven now.<p>As much as the two older parties hate the thought, over the past 20 yearstheir legislation has been scrutinised by the Democrats in the Senate forjustice, compassion and environmental values. Time after time, the twotired, old Parties have predicted the demise of the Democrats, oftenworking in concert behind the scenes to bring try to bring that about. TheAustralian people, however, have thought and voted differently. Australiansdo not trust the two old Parties and the evidence for this is that the lastPrime Minister to have a majority in both houses of the Parliament wasMalcolm Fraser. <p>Neither the Coalition nor the ALP enjoy the generational, "rusted on"support they had in years gone by. There has been a massive cultural shiftand today's political landscape is a brave new world. The political realityof this brave new world is that minor Parties and independents hold, andwill continue to hold, the balance of power in the Senate. The recentMorgan Senate poll, the first such poll for over 18 months, tells us that -and also that the Democrat vote has been maintained. Clearly, Democratsupporters are holding fast and not deserting to One Nation. The samecannot be said for the Coalition's voters. It is also clear thatdisenchanted small ‘l' liberal voters are drifting away from the Coalitionto the Democrats.<p>The fact of the matter is that the battle for the kind of Australia we takeinto the future will be fought in the Senate between the AustralianDemocrats and One Nation. In the coming election, the choice will be stark.The battle will be between tolerance and intolerance, balance and chaos,reconciliation and confrontation. <p>The battle will not be fought in the ‘no man's land' between the Federalseats of Dickson and Oxley. No amount of spin doctoring, media features andcarefully placed articles will change that.<p><FONT SIZE="-1">* John Schumann is senior media adviser to the Leader of the AustralianDemocrats, Senator Meg Lees. </FONT><br clear=all><p><center><img src="http://www.electric.on.net/ads/ads_news/agriffiths_optometrist.gif" width=380 height=60 border=0></center><p><center><hr noshade><A HREF="http://www.electric.on.net"        onMouseOver="waxon('home');        statuson('home'); return true;"        onMouseOut="statusoff(); waxoff('home');        return true;"><IMG name=home SRC="../buttons/butt_home_off.gif" ALT="home" WIDTH="140" HEIGHT="32" BORDER="0"></a><A HREF="../essays/index.html"        onMouseOver="waxon('essays');        statuson('essays'); return true;"        onMouseOut="statusoff(); waxoff('essays');        return true;"><IMG name=essays SRC="../buttons/butt_essays_off.gif" ALT="essays" WIDTH="140" HEIGHT="32" BORDER="0"></a><hr noshade></center><p><A HREF="http://www.electric.on.net">http://www.electric.on.net</A><p>&copy; This work is subject to copyright.
