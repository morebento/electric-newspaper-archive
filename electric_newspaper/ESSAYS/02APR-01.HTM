The economics text booksused to classify these as "infinite". Perhaps the Ozone hole and pollutionhave modified this theory a little. Perhaps one day, a method will bedevised to privatise these too, but for the time being, we seem safe.<p>	Fresh water has always been seen as a "finite" resource. It has beenmanaged and distributed by Governments in the public interest. There isafter all no substitute for fresh water. Users have paid according toformulae which have balanced their level of consumption against theproductive needs of industry and agriculture. Only South Australia has beenfoolish enough to pass control of this natural monopoly to a private Company. <p>	The air-waves are another "finite” natural resource. Given any level oftechnology, limited channels are available for broadcast purposes. Theexisting analogue technology is quite limited. Even if there was the desireto do so, new entrants would be hard to fit in.<p>	Digital technology now offers an explosive increase in the carryingcapacity and broadcast versatility available to broadcasters. To pursue thewater analogy, it is like finding another River Murray, or even an Amazon.<p>	 Digital technology allows the broadcast of several TV signals in the samebandwidth which, today, carries just one analogue channel. High definitionTV, another digital option, can deliver Cinema quality pictures and soundinto your home. Online services like the internet can be provided, as caninteractive services. This technology represents an advance comparable tothe leap from radio to TV.<p>	The Federal Government has the power to call the shots for all Australianbroadcast communications systems and operators. Digital technology haspresented the Federal Government with an historic  opportunity to managethis finite public resource in such a way as to introduce "market forces"into Australian television broadcasting.<p>	The advent of digital TV is also a potential gold mine for the publicpurse. More channels, more users and more services, should mean morelicense fees and more taxation revenue.<p>	What would an honest Government, committed to "user pays", even to theextent of chasing frail, aged, people in nursing homes, do?<p>	What would an honest Government, committed to lower levels of personalincome tax, tax reform and a GST do?<p>	 What would an honest Government, so committed to fiscal restraint that itis prepared to gut our Public Hospital system, to produce a currentsurplus, do?<p>	While we consider these questions, let me tell you the answer that ourFederal Government came up with. The Government has decided to allow theexisting free-to-air networks to use digital TV free of charge and withoutcompetition from another network, until 2008. Think about it.<p>	If, like me, you are still scratching your head trying to work out how ourFederal Government could possibly come up with such an idiotic solution,lets look at the apparently unrelated issue of Media ownership rules inAustralia.<p>	The former Federal Government set the present rules in place some yearsago. The rules do two things. They regulate market dominance across mediasectors,(i.e. print and broadcasting), and they limit foreign penetrationof the local media market generally. This is a pretty cosy deal if youhappen to be one of the existing big players. No competition from outsideand very limited opportunity to compete inside.<p>	Mr. Murdoch's News Corporation is confined to a position of massivedominance of print media. He is unable to get into TV. He is now anAmerican citizen. No doubt he finds this very inconvenient. He would love adigital network to call his own.<p>	Mr. Packer has a different problem. He has almost all of his eggs in theNine Network basket . He would love to acquire John Fairfax, instantlysnapping up the Melbourne Age and The Sydney Morning Herald cash cows.<p>	Fairfax is of course the last remnant of a major independent print mediain Australia. It provides some choice other than a Murdoch paper, at leastin Sydney and Melbourne. Mr. Packer wanted John Howard to change the  ruleslast year, but a public outcry from people including Malcolm Fraser and abackbench revolt saved the day. Mr. Packer now employs both former ALPheavy Graham Richardson and former Liberal Party National Director  AndrewRobb.<p>	Speaking no doubt with a healthy sprinkling of self-interest, Mr. Murdochis reported in The Australian of 28-29 March as saying of the Government'sdecision to see the merit in Robb's  case on behalf of his client.   <p>	"It was unthinkable that anyone would have the gall to ask for it and that anyone would have the gall to give it."<p>	It is hard to disagree with him.<p>	Having denied Mr. Packer once over Fairfax, the Government has handed hima license to print money until 2008. Unlike all the rest of us, existingfree-to-air broadcasters are to be sheltered from competition. They are tobe given exclusive access to a public asset.<p>	I am still scratching my head, wondering. Could it have anything to dowith the fact that a Federal election is expected this year ?  <p><center><hr noshade><A HREF="http://www.electric.on.net"        onMouseOver="waxon('home');        statuson('home'); return true;"        onMouseOut="statusoff(); waxoff('home');        return true;"><IMG name=home SRC="../buttons/butt_home_off.gif" ALT="home" WIDTH="140" HEIGHT="32" BORDER="0"></a><A HREF="../essays/index.html"        onMouseOver="waxon('essays');        statuson('essays'); return true;"        onMouseOut="statusoff(); waxoff('essays');        return true;"><IMG name=essays SRC="../buttons/butt_essays_off.gif" ALT="essays" WIDTH="140" HEIGHT="32" BORDER="0"></a><hr noshade></center><p><A HREF="http://www.electric.on.net">http://www.electric.on.net</A><p>&copy; This work is subject to copyright.
