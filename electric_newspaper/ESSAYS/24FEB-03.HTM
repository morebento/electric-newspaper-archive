In those days, the great Satan was Iran and Hussein waslocked in a bloody, pointless war of attrition.The Americans were happy toarm him.The Britishand the Europeans were busily selling him equipment, materials andknow-how.Hiscapacity to produce and deliver weapons of mass-desruction dates back tothis time.<p>	During the conflict with Iran,Hussein used mustard gas on Iraniancivilians. In some cases,even hospitals were hit. At the time, nothing muchwas said. Iranians did not seem to matter, and he was our buddy in the Gulf.<p>	Eventually, both countries accepted that neither could win and thispointless war ended.The war had suited the U.S. as it was punishment byproxy for the Iranian hostage fiasco.The war also suited Israel, as it tiedup two potential enemies in a debilitating struggle and split the loyaltiesof the Arab world.<p>	 Hussein was not quiet for long .He had learned his lesson, not to pick ona country big enough to defend itself. His next victim, Kuwait, was toosmall to resist any invasion.<p>	Occupation of Kuwait gave Hussein immense oil reserves and associatedeconomic clout. It also placed him in a leadership role in the Arab world.The U.S. was not going to put up with any more Arab oil shocks like thosein the 1970's. Israel was justifiably scared of a belligerent Husseindragging the Middle East into another waragainst the Jewish State. Something had to be done.<p>	As luck would have it, Russia was particularly in need of Americanlargesse at this time. China, in transition from Deng, was also focusedelsewhere. Britain, as always, was at the ready. Even France, normally keento advance its own interests in the Arab world at the expense of itsallies, showed uncharacteristic solidarity.<p>	The community of Nations approved of operation "Desert Storm". Theinsincere justification of " restoring democracy " to Kuwait  by returningthe autocraticEl-Sabah family had nothing to do with it. Bosnia is the classic case of afar greaterhuman disaster, largely ignored for years. The critical ingredients herewere oil and Israel.<p>	"Desert Storm" should have finished Hussein off. The fact that he is stillthere and firmly in control is testimony to the ruthless Police State hehas under him.<p>	If he is killed in any military action taken by the U.S., there is no oneotherthan his son (who by all accounts is worse!) to take over. This woulddestabilizethe whole region, probably making way for the Syrian strongman, Assad, tofill thevacume. This would be no better for the U.S. and arguably, a lot worse forIsrael.<p>	The other consideration is how Hussein would react to any military strike.He does not have the conventional weapons required to inflict massivelosses on the U.S. What he probably does have is enough chemical orbiological weaponry to devastate any densely populated area. All herequires is a method of delivery. The Israelis are fully aware of theshocking effect of low-tec delivery methods. What is more low-tec than acar or a truck? How vulnerable is Israel to an attack of this kind?<p>	The US has rounded up the "usual suspects", Canada , Britain, New  Zealandand Australia. It is hard to see how it is in our interest to be involvedin this brawl on the other side of the planet. Sucking up to Uncle Sam isthe only credibleexplaination. As Australians we should be a lot more concerned with themeltdown inIndonesia and its direct implications. Let's hope that our SAS contingentis home andsafe before we need them.<p><hr noshade><p><A HREF="http://www.electric.on.net">http://www.electric.on.net</A><p>&copy; This work is subject to copyright.
