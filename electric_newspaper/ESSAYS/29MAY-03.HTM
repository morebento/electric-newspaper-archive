The last Budget was heralded by theGovernment as the end of austerity, a time for self-congratulation becausedebt was under control. This Budget was to offer some relief and hope forSouth Australians. Instead it has heightened insecurity. <p>Ironically this is a Budget that is big on austerity and low on sharing thefruits which the Government claimed would grow from its debt reductionstrategy. Perversely this is a Budget that rejects  hronically highunemployment in its rhetoric, but enshrines it into its projections.<p>With the State Bank and SGIC crises behind us and State debt at levels notexperienced since the mid-1980s, the Government had the opportunity toloosen the purse strings and introduce a stimulus package which made somecontribution to a reduction in unemployment. Debt management now requires ahigh growth strategy rather than a tight fiscal strategy. This shift isabsolutely justifiable and sustainable with debt as a percentage of GrossState Product set to decline steadily over the next few years to well below20 percent. The consequences of a debt first strategy are clearly spelt outin the Budget papers.<p>Employment and economic growth estimates in the Budget paint a frighteningpicture for those looking for work. At 0 percent this year and 1 percentnext year employment growth will not be adequate to bring down unemploymentto the national average over three years as the Government promises. IndeedSouth Australian unemployment is set to hover around 10 percent over thenext few years.<p>At a time when a substantial fiscal stimulus is necessary to help kickstartthe South Australian economy the Government has done nothing to acceleratethe States economic growth rate. This is a formula for sustained declineand a further widening of the gap between South Australia's performance andthat of the nation as whole. <p>A measure of the Government’s hypocrisy in the Budget is the claim thatinfrastructure expenditure has been increased when in fact the allocationhas declined by $130 million. By failing to invest more substantially ininfrastructure investment and end public sector job losses the StateGovernment will face chronically high unemployment and poor economic growthover the next few years.<p>If the Government is serious about tackling the jobs crisis an additional$1 billion should have been allocated to infrastructure investment. Thiscould have been accommodated by easing debt reduction. Additional capitalexpenditure would flow through to higher growth and reduce debt. This isthe high road to economic development which the Government is so reluctantto take,<p>With the poor outlook for national jobs growth over the next twelve monthsit was vital that the State Government introduce additional job creationmeasures to help offset the negative impact of the Asian Financial crisison South Australia.<p>One of the great disappointments in the Budget is that the 4500 jobs to becreated by Jobs Package are likely to be offset by further job lossesarising from cuts to education expenditure and further  outsourcing ofservices. The Jobs Package does contain some positive initiatives howeverwhich if linked to a much more substantial industry and infrastructuredevelopment package would begin to make some inroads into unemployment.<p>Higher levels of productive investment and additional support for localbusiness development are necessary to break the cycle of decline andchronic long term unemployment in South Australia.<p>Claims that privatisation of ETSA will have financial benefits to the Stateare illusory. Likely sale prices will result in a net loss to taxpayers ofaround $880 million over ten years. Tying the Budgets forward estimates tothe sale of ETSA is a cheap political trick, likely to fuel furthercynicism about the proposed sale.<p>While many of the increases in revenue in the Budget are regressive changesto land tax, gambling taxes are positive. In general the strongacknowledgment in this Budget of the need to broaden the States revenuebase points to the need for a public review of taxation and revenue optionsfor the future.<p>Perhaps the most disappointing aspect of the Budget is the Government hasfailed after four Budgets to deliver a coherent economic and employmentdevelopment strategy for South Australia. The costs of this will bemeasured in the monthly ABS jobs figures. They will provide no comfort forthe Government as it prepares for the next election.<p><font size=-1>* John Spoehr is  deputy director of the Centre for Labour Research at theUniversity of Adelaide</font><br clear=all><center><A HREF="mailto:lhearn@msnsa.com.au"><img src="http://www.electric.on.net/ads/ads_news/media_sales.gif" width=380 height=60 border=0></A></center><p><center><hr noshade><A HREF="http://www.electric.on.net"        onMouseOver="waxon('home');        statuson('home'); return true;"        onMouseOut="statusoff(); waxoff('home');        return true;"><IMG name=home SRC="../buttons/butt_home_off.gif" ALT="home" WIDTH="140" HEIGHT="32" BORDER="0"></a><A HREF="../essays/index.html"        onMouseOver="waxon('essays');        statuson('essays'); return true;"        onMouseOut="statusoff(); waxoff('essays');        return true;"><IMG name=essays SRC="../buttons/butt_essays_off.gif" ALT="essays" WIDTH="140" HEIGHT="32" BORDER="0"></a><hr noshade></center><p><A HREF="http://www.electric.on.net">http://www.electric.on.net</A><p>&copy; This work is subject to copyright.
