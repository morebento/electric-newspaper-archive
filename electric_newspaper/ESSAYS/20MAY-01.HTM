This report is provided in the hope that the South Australiancommunity has the opportunity to compare our findings with the results ofscoping studies commissioned by the Government on privatisation. <p>It is vital that all of these scoping studies are subject to publicscrutiny to ensure that vested interests do not drive the sale process -this is particularly critical where consultants are likely to receivesubstantial fees - up to $30 million in the case of the ETSA/Optima sale.The stakes and the risks are high. Given that future Governments' handswill be tied by any decision to privatise, the South Australian public mustbe made aware of the longer term consequences of any privatisation. TheSouth Australian public have the right to demand an assessment processwhich is transparent and subject to public scrutiny before any decision toprivatise is made.<p>The great risk to the South Australian community from the current wave ofprivatisation proposals is the likelihood that significant medium termfinancial losses from privatisation will be ignored in favour of short termpolitical gains. If driven by this ideological blindness the privatisationsof TAB/Lotteries, ETSA/Optima and the Ports Corporation will create a $1250million blackhole in the budget over the next ten years. In this context it is disturbing that the South Australian Government'sapproach toprivatisation appears to be grounded in a combination of politicalpragmatism, a pre-occupation with short term debt reduction and anantipathy towards the public sector.<p>A more sober assessment of the likely impact of privatisation is required -such an assessment from government appointed consultants is unlikely givensubstantial vested interests in privatisation. While short term revenueraising from privatisation of public enterprises would enable some publicdebt to be retired, the interest savings from debt reduction would beinsufficient to offset the revenue lost to Government arising fromprivatisation. The loss of revenue to Government from privatisation of theLotteries Commission/TAB, Ports Corporation, HomeStart and ETSA whileappearing to offer some short term financial gain in terms of debtreduction will on the basis of our analysis, harm the financial position ofthe State.<p>If partially utilised for the purposes of debt reduction, the revenuestreams of these enterprises under public ownership will do much more toimprove the financial position of the State than privatisation. On thebasis of modest enterprise performance and likely sale prices, theprivatisation of ETSA/Optima, TAB/Lotteries Commission and PortsCorporation will result in a $1250 million 'black hole' in the Budget, a$1250 million net loss to South Australian taxpayers over a ten yearperiod. Interest savings are not expected to exceed the loss of revenuefrom the enterprises unless sale prices of $7 billion for ETSA/Optima, $2billion for TAB/Lotteries and $500 million for Ports Corp are achieved.<p>Sale prices for ETSA/Optima are estimated to be between $4-6 billion whileTAB/Lotteries is likely to attract around $1.4 billion based on interstateexperience. On financial grounds alone the privatisation of the enterprisesin question is not justifiable unless the total sale price exceeds $9500million. This is highly unlikely.<p>Much of the momentum for privatisation in SA over the last four years wasgenerated by an escalation of public sector debt arising from the SGIC andState Bank bail-outs. This problem was reinforced by the gradual declineover 1980s of Commonwealth grants, the relative severity of the recessionin SA and,  arguably, an insufficient taxation effort. <p>While State debt increased sharply due to the financial shocks of the early1990s, debt as a percentage of GSP has declined significantly from nearly28 percent in 1993 to 21 percent in 1997. Debt levels are now athistorically low levels. They also compare favourably to benchmarks set inthe mid to late 1980s when economic growth rates were considerably strongerthan those of the mid 1990s.<p>A significant risk of privatisation is that it will actually harm ourfinancial position. Rather than lower State debt, privatisation is likelyto result in an escalation of debt. In this way the proposed privatisationswould be smaller in scale but have similar effects to the recent financialcrises already experienced in South Australia.<p>Evidence from the OECD only reinforces this concern. While some short termeconomic gains appear to be made through debt reduction, the loss ofrevenue streams and assets, often results in a net deterioration ofGovernments overall financial position as the OECD suggest.<p>"Each sale of a public asset only provides the government with a once-and-for-all source of revenue.  The treatment of the proceeds of such sales asdeficit reduction, or even as negative outlays, may lead to the incorrectimpression that the Government's budget position has improved when all thathas happened is that its financing has been made easier.  Moreover,continual disposal of the Government's assets leads inevitably to thedepletion of its wealth.  Once the stock of assets is depleted, alternativefinancing must be found. The danger of bringing revenues from asset saleson-budget rather than keeping them off-budget is that, by running downtheir stock of assets, Governments will eventually find themselves evenmore constrained either to raise taxes, accept further increases in netdebt, or monetise future deficits in order to finance the flow ofexpenditure" (OECD, 1986).<p>This report has revealed that rather than minimise risks to the taxpayerthe sale of Government enterprises can be very Risky Business - resultingin huge financial losses. In our assessment of the public enterprises inquestion the risks outweigh the rewards of privatisation.<p><font size=-1>John Spoehr is deputy director of the Centre for Labour Research at theUniversity of Adelaide.</font><p><center><hr noshade><A HREF="http://www.electric.on.net"        onMouseOver="waxon('home');        statuson('home'); return true;"        onMouseOut="statusoff(); waxoff('home');        return true;"><IMG name=home SRC="../buttons/butt_home_off.gif" ALT="home" WIDTH="140" HEIGHT="32" BORDER="0"></a><A HREF="../essays/index.html"        onMouseOver="waxon('essays');        statuson('essays'); return true;"        onMouseOut="statusoff(); waxoff('essays');        return true;"><IMG name=essays SRC="../buttons/butt_essays_off.gif" ALT="essays" WIDTH="140" HEIGHT="32" BORDER="0"></a><hr noshade></center><p><A HREF="http://www.electric.on.net">http://www.electric.on.net</A><p>&copy; This work is subject to copyright.
