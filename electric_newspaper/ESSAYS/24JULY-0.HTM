He survived with the narrowest of margins,with a tied vote of 22 votes all, the issue was decided on the casting voteof the Speaker, Liberal Party Stalwart, and ex Minister under Dean Brown,John Oswald M.P.<p>What makes Mr Ingerson's survival all the more curious is that he survivedon the vote of so called Independent Liberal M.P. for Gordon, (based aroundthe City of Mount Gambier in the south east of the State) Rory McEwen. Hewas not only one of the five person Privileges Committee set up by theHouse of Assembly to investigate as to whether or not Graham Ingerson hadmisled the Parliament on the issues surrounding the dismissal of the formerChief Executive Officer of the South Australian Thoroughbred RacingAssociation Merv Hill in 1997, but he was also one of the majority membersof the Privileges Committee who found that Mr Ingerson had deliberatelymisled the Parliament.<p>Rory McEwen is prone to jumping to his feet in Parliament and beating hisbreast, calling on all Members, and in particular the major politicalparties to "lift their game" and to "lift their standards of behaviour andethics in the Parliament". In the debate on the Privileges Committee'sreport on Tuesday the 21st July 1998 <p>Rory first indicated that he was about to do a backflip on Graham Ingersonwhen he complained about the culture of the Parliament where Ministers pastand present, of all political colours had, in his view, been sloppy withthe truth in their answers to questions in Parliament, and that they hadallegedly suffered no penalty. Therefore he reasoned that Graham Ingersonshould be judged by the culture of the Parliament of the day, rather thanon the principles that had been adhered to in the past by the Mother ofParliamentary democracy, the British House of Commons, where if a Ministerintentionally misleads the House, they resign from the Ministry or aredismissed by the Prime Minister or Premier.<p>What Rory McEwen conveniently overlooked was that if the standards expectedof Members of Parliament, and in particular Ministers of the Crown, is aslow as he states (in many respects I could agree with that statement), thenthat in itself is no excuse to accept those lower standards. Rory McEwenshould have drawn a line in the sand. In a case where a Minister has beennot only found guilty by all members of the Privileges Committee formisleading the House, but in a majority decision found that he haddeliberately misled the House, and that that report is adopted unanimouslyby the House of Assembly, then there is only one penalty sufficient torestore the sorts of standards and ethics of Parliamentary behaviour thatRory McEwen so often says should apply, namely Graham Ingerson'sresignation from the Ministry or his dismissal from Office by the Premier.If the <p>Premier refuses to act, as he has consistently refused to do so in theIngerson affair, then the House of Assembly should pass a vote of noconfidence in that Minister. <p>What Rory McEwen did by not voting for the motion of no confidence inGraham Ingerson, was to say to all future Ministers of whatever politicalpersuasion, that it is acceptable to not only mislead the Parliament inanswers that they give, but it is acceptable for Ministers of the Crown,not withstanding their oath that they swear when they are made Ministers,to deliberately mislead the Parliament. Try and explain the morality ofthat situation to any primary school child.<p>From a purely party political position the Labor Opposition is far betteroff in having Graham Ingerson where he is, on the front bench, mortallywounded, strung across a barbed wire fence, with the Liberal Party in theState bleeding. The credibility of the Olsen Liberal Government and hisMinisters has been much diminished by the Ingerson affair, in particularthe lack of leadership shown by the Premier in this matter. He has allowedhis own personal considerations of retaining the leadership of the LiberalParty in the short term, to override the moral imperative of dealing withIngerson in a straight forward way by sacking him.<p>To be frank, if I had my choice between having the Labor Party in itscurrent position, where politically it is better for Ingerson to remainwhere he is, slowly bleeding the Liberal Party to death, or having theinstitution of Parliament reinvigorated with the standards ofaccountability of its Ministers being reinforced by having the Ministerforced to resign his Office, I would prefer the latter.<p>It is precisely because of the way politicians deal with themselves inthese sorts of matters which brings discredit to all Members of Parliamentand to Parliamentary institutions. It further alienates the public from theParliamentary process, who cannot understand why a Minister of the Crown isallowed to get off scott free after having deliberately misled Parliament,when they themselves know that if any school child deliberately lied totheir teacher, or to their parents, that that child would receive greaterpunishment than a Minister of the Crown received. It is because of thisalienation of the public from the Parliamentary process that allows therise of “Hansonism” in this country, because people become disillusionedwith main stream politics and mainstream political parties.<p>Rory McEwen did himself and the Parliamentary system in the State no goodwhatsoever by his back down over the Graham Ingerson affair. He will neverever again be able to rise to his feet in the State Parliament and complainabout the standards of Parliamentary behaviour, or Parliamentary ethics. Hehad the opportunity to draw the line in the sand and to demand that all Members ofParliament in the State, adhere to a certain minimum acceptable standard,and he failed that test. <p>The failure of the State Parliament to carry a vote of no confidence inGraham Ingerson has taught current and future Ministers of the Crown thatno matter what your sins, provided you are prepared to "tough' out publicopinion and have something that you can hold over either your Party or yourPremier, then you can ride out the storm and suffer little or no penalty atall. The losers are the public of South Australian and the Parliamentaryprocess.<br clear=all><p><center><img src="http://www.electric.on.net/ads/ads_news/agriffiths_optometrist.gif" width=380 height=60 border=0></center><p><center><hr noshade><A HREF="http://www.electric.on.net"        onMouseOver="waxon('home');        statuson('home'); return true;"        onMouseOut="statusoff(); waxoff('home');        return true;"><IMG name=home SRC="../buttons/butt_home_off.gif" ALT="home" WIDTH="140" HEIGHT="32" BORDER="0"></a><A HREF="../essays/index.html"        onMouseOver="waxon('essays');        statuson('essays'); return true;"        onMouseOut="statusoff(); waxoff('essays');        return true;"><IMG name=essays SRC="../buttons/butt_essays_off.gif" ALT="essays" WIDTH="140" HEIGHT="32" BORDER="0"></a><hr noshade></center><p><A HREF="http://www.electric.on.net">http://www.electric.on.net</A><p>&copy; This work is subject to copyright.
