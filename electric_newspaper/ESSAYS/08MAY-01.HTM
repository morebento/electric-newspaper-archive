That bipartisanship was neverevident when he was a Minister in the Bannon/Arnold Labor Governments.  Helaughed at the Liberal Party attacks on the State Bank.  And in earlierdays he sneered at Roxby Downs.  <p>But just what does Mike Rann stand for?  Well today he is againstprivatisation because he’s finished doing all the privatising that he wantsto do.  Yes, he was there when the Labor Party privatised the State Bankand Rann was larger than life when the Labor Government sold off itsmajority holding in the South Australian Gas Company.  And where was Rannwhen Federal Labor was privatising the Commonwealth Bank, Qantas, andindirectly Australian Airlines and the Commonwealth Serum Laboratories?Any reader who can find a speech by Mike Rann attacking privatisation bythe Federal and State Labor Governments will score from me not only a tourof Parliament House, but a lunch as well.<p>Nowadays, Mike doesn’t like privatisation.  Why?  Well he is a politicalchameleon.  He is into political mayhem rather than bipartisanship.  <p>Consider this.  If you are keeper of the household purse-strings and suffera massive and unexpected financial setback beyond your control, there wouldbe three options.  Firstly, you could prune your expenditure, secondly, youcould increase your income and thirdly, you could borrow more to meet thegap between income and expenditure.  Of course it may be a combination ofall three.  The members of the household may not like what has happened.They will grizzle and whine.  But unless a disciplined financial approachis adopted, you run the risk of bankruptcy.<p>This is no different to what happened in South Australia.  Under theBannon/Arnold Labor Governments over $4 billion was lost.  That is $4,000million or around $4,500 for every person between the ages of 15 and 65 inSouth Australia.  $3.15 billion was blown on the State Bank, around $800million in SGIC (including $500 million on just one building in Melbourne!)and $60 million on the extraordinary Scrimber project.  <p>In 1993 the Liberal Party Government inherited this problem and had to fixit.  The Liberals were like the head of the household who had an unexpectedfinancial setback.  The voters have grizzled and whined.  The LiberalGovernment has tried hard not to increase taxes and charges and yes, it hashad to cut back on expenditure.  <p>The Labor Party, led by Rann whose financial acumen I will not comment onbecause it may risk a defamation action, has suddenly become an expert infinancial management.  It is a bit like saying that infamous escapee,Brendan Abbott, should become the next Queensland Minister of Police!  <p>Take SA Water for example.  The Liberal Government has saved $10 millionper annum on water charges following the outsourcing of the management ofSA Water.  These savings have been used in the areas of health andeducation.  United Water’s management contract has led to an increase injobs in the water and waste-water industry in South Australia.  Rannpresents this positive development in a bad light.  But he doesn’t tell youthat in the last year of the Labor Government, SA Water (EWS) lost $47million.  So just what was Rann’s policy on water?  Well don’t botherasking because there wasn’t one.  <p>The Liberal Government has committed itself to selling off ETSA and Optima. The National Electricity Market has introduced great uncertainties andhigh risks.  The Carr Labor Government in New South Wales is adamant thatit will privatise its electricity industry.  But of course Rann is now inhis post-privatisation period.  <p>The successful privatisation of ETSA and Optima will slash $4-6 billion offthe South Australian debt.  It will give the Government a chance to begenerous rather than mean.  The long-suffering taxpayers of South Australiawill start winning again.<p>When all is said and done, good financial management is about getting itright.  Whatever one may say about the style and the problems of theLiberal Government, there have been no major financial failures orsignificant losses over the last four years as it has undertaken thehazardous task of repairing the enormous financial damage done by Labor.And most importantly of all, Mike Rann has not once come forward with analternative financial plan.  Perhaps that’s not so surprising in view ofhis track record.<p>Ask yourself this question.  If you were the keeper of the purse-strings inthe household which had suffered a dramatic financial setback, would you goto Mike (Also) Rann for advice?    <p><center><hr noshade><A HREF="http://www.electric.on.net"        onMouseOver="waxon('home');        statuson('home'); return true;"        onMouseOut="statusoff(); waxoff('home');        return true;"><IMG name=home SRC="../buttons/butt_home_off.gif" ALT="home" WIDTH="140" HEIGHT="32" BORDER="0"></a><A HREF="../essays/index.html"        onMouseOver="waxon('essays');        statuson('essays'); return true;"        onMouseOut="statusoff(); waxoff('essays');        return true;"><IMG name=essays SRC="../buttons/butt_essays_off.gif" ALT="essays" WIDTH="140" HEIGHT="32" BORDER="0"></a><hr noshade></center><p><A HREF="http://www.electric.on.net">http://www.electric.on.net</A><p>&copy; This work is subject to copyright.
