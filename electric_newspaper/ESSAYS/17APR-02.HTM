Phillipsâ "Emigrantsâ Guide to Australia" (1852) warned womensettlers that "the drawing room accomplishments of singing, dancing,painting and crochet would stand no shadow of a chance against the highlyprized virtues of churning, baking, preserving, cheese-making and similarmatters".  <p>Caroline Chisholm was arguably Australia's first social worker and hasdeservedly received credit for her pioneering role.  However, she was onrecord as saying that women should certainly be paid less than men because"high wages tempt many girls to keep single while it encourages indolentand lazy men to depend more and more upon their wivesâ industry than upontheir exertions, thus partly reversing the design of nature".  <p>The New South Wales Parliament also had something to say on the matter,when in 1835 a select committee reported that women should not be broughtinto the workforce except "either as houseservants, or in some of the moreordinary occupations".  Feminist historian, Dr Katrina Alford, in tracingthe economic history of women in Australia in the period 1788-1850, noted,"the limitations imposed on married womensâ property ownership during theperiod, and the legal uncertainty whether they were entitled to bequeaththeir own property, discouraged female entrepreneurship".  Indeed shehighlighted the example of one Eliza Walsh, a single woman of independentmeans, who took her case to the British Government after Governor Macquariehad refused her a land grant on the basis of her sex.  The good Governorargued that his policy was based on the fact that women were "incapable ofcultivating land".  <p>It was not until 1894 that women in South Australia received the right tovote.  This State was the first in Australia to give women the right tovote and in fact ranked as the third country or State in the world afterWyoming in 1868 and New Zealand in 1893.  In 1897 Catherine Helen Spence,at the age of 72, became the first woman political candidate in Australiawhen she stood unsuccessfully for election to the Federal Convention. <p>However, South Australia was the last State to elect a woman to its lowerHouse.  The year was 1959 and the member was Joyce Steele, who later becamethe first woman to achieve cabinet rank in the South Australian Parliament. Jessie Cooper was the first woman elected to the Legislative Council, alsoin 1959.  Both women represented the Liberal and Country League, as it wasthen called, but still had to face a court challenge to the validity oftheir election on the grounds that the State Constitution only referred to"he's" being elected!  <p>In the Commonwealth Parliament in the 80 year period following Federationin 1901, only 4 women were elected to the House of Representatives and 12to the Senate.  <p>For most of this century women were discouraged from entering theworkforce.  During World War II they did men's work for a fraction of thepay.  After World War II women received only 54% of the men's basic wageand this was then increased to 75%.  Eventually equal pay for equal workwas recognised by the Commonwealth Arbitration Commission in December 1972.<p>Only recently a woman doctor who graduated in 1960 told me there were only6 women in the first year medical studentsâ class of around 160.  All 6graduated without failing any years.  They were among only 70 graduates,many of whom would have been students who had failed earlier years.  Thesewomen still have a clear recollection of being discriminated against inlectures and feeling that they had to perform better just to be on levelterms with their male peers.  But in their first year as interns thesefemale doctors were paid around £10 per week, while the males were paid £12per week.  Another woman from the same era walked into the first lecture ina law subject with a girlfriend and the professor lecturing them said "whatare you two girls doing here?"<p>In the early 1960's it was still common for parents to discourage theirdaughters from attending university, although they may have been moregifted than the sons who did attend university.  <p>Until quite recently women have been discriminated against when seekinghousing or business loans.  Single women with jobs found it difficult toobtain the necessary finance from banks.<p>We have come a long way in the last generation but there is still somedistance to travel.  <p>In the recent history of this State and nation women were denied the rightto own property, and the right to vote, were discouraged from working andif they did work were paid significantly less.  The glass ceiling has madecareer advancement difficult.  Should the government or men of Australiaapologise to today's women for the discrimination against past generationsof women?<p><center><hr noshade><A HREF="http://www.electric.on.net"        onMouseOver="waxon('home');        statuson('home'); return true;"        onMouseOut="statusoff(); waxoff('home');        return true;"><IMG name=home SRC="../buttons/butt_home_off.gif" ALT="home" WIDTH="140" HEIGHT="32" BORDER="0"></a><A HREF="../essays/index.html"        onMouseOver="waxon('essays');        statuson('essays'); return true;"        onMouseOut="statusoff(); waxoff('essays');        return true;"><IMG name=essays SRC="../buttons/butt_essays_off.gif" ALT="essays" WIDTH="140" HEIGHT="32" BORDER="0"></a><hr noshade></center><p><A HREF="http://www.electric.on.net">http://www.electric.on.net</A><p>&copy; This work is subject to copyright.
