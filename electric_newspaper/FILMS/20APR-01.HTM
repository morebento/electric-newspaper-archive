Coyote ever did, andit's the presence of Goodman that really gives this intriguingly fancifulkids' movie a kick. As odiously swank real estate swindler Ocious Potter,Goodman tricks his clients, the Lenders, out of their Great-Aunt's house,and incurs the wrath of "The Borrowers", a morally-upright family offour-inch high eccentrics recently befriended by the young Pete Lender(Bradley Pierce), leading to a catalogue of cruelties directed at the big,bad "human bean".<p>With striking special effects (a melding of stop-motion andcomputer-generation), an unexpectedly surreal look straight out of TerryGilliam's Brazil, likeable performances by "The Borrowers" (including JimBroadbent as Dad "Pod Clock"), and juicy guest spots for Hugh Laurie andRuby Wax, The Borrowers is that rarity: a film directed at the rugrats thatadults will enjoy hugely, jam-packed with off-colour humour, flavoursomeweirdness and Goodman violently thwarted at every turn. Seriously - I'm nothaving a lend of you. <B>***1/2</B><p><B>DECONSTRUCTING HARRY (M)</B> - Woody Allen's harshest movie since 1992'sHusbands And Wives is this phantasmagoria upon his life with his acclaimedauthor "Harry Block" suffering a writer's-block-fuelled semi-breakdown, aspast, present and fiction blur. His ex-wife's sister (Judy Davis) wants tokill him for fictionalising their secret affair in his new novel; anotherex (Elisabeth Shue as a smitten one-time fan of Harry's) is leaving him forthe very inoffensive Billy Crystal; his old college wants to honour him andhe rolls up (after a minor odyssey upstate) with a brassy black hooker(Hazelle Goodman in her debut) and, eventually, a corpse in tow; and hisimaginary characters keep popping up to discuss finer details of the plot.<p>A veritable Who's Who of Woody concerns (the Grim Reaper makes a grumpyappearance, Harry attends therapy, grabs his estranged son at school andpens a book about - get this - an unforgettable Oriental prostitute - youcan see the royal thumbing of his nose at us every step of the way), withseveral of his favourite players (Davis, Julie Kavner and Mariel Hemingway)rubbing shoulders with a slew of new faces (Stanley Tucci, Bob Balaban,Kirstie Alley, Julia Louis-Dreyfus, Richard Benjamin, Eric Bogosian andeven Robin Williams and Demi Moore), Deconstructing Harry is as personal asAllen's most difficult movie, Stardust Memories (1980) - perhaps even moreso. Whether his dedicated contingent of admirers want to know quite thismuch about him (or be subject to this level of vitriolic criticism) isanother matter entirely, but there's no denying Deconstructing Harry isWoody's first movie in ages which really has guts. <B>****</B><p><B>FALLEN (M)</B> - Denzel Washington is irritatingly bland as aserial-killer-specialising detective onto the epidemic spread of an ancientEvil after the passing on of said Evil from a incantation-mumblingmass-murderer (Elias Koteas) recently gassed (after strikingHellfire-and-tilted-camera opening credits). John Goodman is pretty good inthe flat role of the "buddy", while Donald Sutherland and Embeth Davidtzwalk through it as, respectively, Washington's superior and a supernaturalexpert, and every passer-by "infected" (in cliche sequences borrowed fromThe Hidden, as the Evil moves through crowds like incredibly virulentmeasles) tunelessly sings, in a tedious running joke, the Rolling Stones'Time Is On My Side, while the film noir-inspired rain pours down outsideand everyone does their best to look edgy.<p>However, Fallen badly over-reaches itself trying to convince you that it'sactually a bona-fide Apocalypse fable, and throws any suspense out thewindow with a finale so obviously filmed in an imitation-snowy studio, andwith nervy characters pointing guns at each other willy-nilly, that theeffect is sorely ridiculous. Armageddon out of here! <B>**1/2</B><p><B>GREAT EXPECTATIONS (M)</B> - Dickens' novel gets the grand updating treatmentin this flashily empty, ego-driven nonsense that's always watchable ifpretty brainless. Finnegan Bell blossoms as an artist in Florida, passinghis childhood days taking dancing lessons with dotty Mrs. Dinsmoor (AnneBancroft hamming it up) and her niece Estella, and having a terrifyingexperience at the mercy of fugitive murderer Lustig (Robert DeNiro,fearsome and foul-mouthed enough to give any Dickens groupie heartpalpitations). Growing up to be the callow Ethan Hawke, he's tempted to NewYork and an exhibition of his fussy paintings, where he runs into Estella,now grown up to be emaciated Gwyneth Paltrow and engaged to Hank Azaria,but still happy to show up at Finn's apartment and get her gear off forsome posey portraits.<p>American-debutting director Alfonso Cuaron trowels on the zappy editingand, especially in the Florida sequences, a troppo-from-the-Sun look that'srather annoying, while also allowing Bancroft and the under-used DeNiro tohog the limelight away from the empty performances of the star-crossedlovers (it's Hawke's worst performance ever, while Paltrow looks ready topass out from starvation any second). It's perhaps not as bad as it couldhave been, but don't expect too much. <B>**1/2</B><p><B>LOST IN SPACE (M)</B> - This long-awaited movie version of the 60s cult TVclassic series is a huge disappointment, an ugly, crummy, hard-to-followmess with much-trumpeted special effects that look unfinished and vary fromthe competent to the idiotic. The set-up is much the same as the series as,in 2058, John Robinson (William Hurt) plans to take his family on aten-year cybersleep trip to Alpha Centauri to hopefully colonise distantspace, but his plans are scuppered when Dr. Zachary Smith (Gary Oldman)sabotages the ship and, when abandoned by his superiors, winds up goingwith them, kicking, screaming and conspiring all the way. Hurt and wifeMimi Rogers spout hateful American family values bereft of any irony,Heather Graham's Judy Robinson bookishly engages in reams of cod philosophywith none of the knowing humour of the old show, Matt Le Blanc (from TV'sFriends) struts about drearily knocking off awful one-liners as the dorkyMajor on hand for would-be love interest, and the main gist of the story (atime-continuum warping of the future with crab-like aliens thrown in) isconfusing, irritating and, incredibly enough, boring.<p>The monsters pale in comparison to Starship Troopers' marauding beasts, anda friendly, product-placement alien (soon to be on every toy-shop shelfacross the globe) looks fuzzily super-imposed and ready to suddenlyadvertise Coco Pops, while the actors are awfully wasted, with Oldman, oncethe greatest British actor of his generation, poncing through a role thatshould have been simply wondrous (the fey, cowardly, queeny Smith havingbeen so memorably played by Jonathan Harris in the original) and obviouslyhaving a huge time as he takes the money and runs, but hampered by dialogueso badly post-synched it seems Smith's strayed out of a spaghetti Western. <p>Indeed, the whole movie is obviously hurried - even unfinished - as if tomeet a release deadline, as Hurt and Rogers fall in love all over again inthe most risible circumstances and their kids have various rites of passageas lamentably five-minutes-ago effects setpieces lurch into shot anddirector Stephen Hopkins (The Ghost And The Darkness) treats the viewerwith all the contempt he feels they deserve. And while Sphere might offer aterrible conclusion, Lost In Space doesn't even have one, and just fizzesout all of a sudden and you're left aghast and thinking Hopkins and Co.just ran out of film, money or (more probably) patience. A sad and sorryfilming of an esteemed camp legend, Lost In Space is hopelessly misplaced. <B>**</B><p><B>LOVE ETC... (M)</B> - This twee French comedy with millennial underpinnings buta heart of pure cliche has a love triangle between two chums, Benoit (YvanAttal) and Pierre (Charles Berling), and the woman (Charlotte Gainsbourg)dreary Benoit marries (yep, that old chestnut). Gainsbourg is almostappealing but totally wet as the fragile girl, while Attal is a drip andBerling intolerably smarmy as Pierre, and director Marion Vernoux gussiesup every line of dialogue, every endlessly meaningful glance between thethree leads, and seemingly every shot in a desperate attempt to trend-ify ahoary old story. It isn't anywhere near the rarefied cinema many would haveyou believe, as Love Etc... just brims with pretension, emptiness,arrogance and so on and so on... and so on. <B>**1/2</B><p><B>MONEY TALKS (MA)</B> - Chris Tucker (who you may remember as "Ruby Rod" in TheFifth Element - no? hardly surprising really) is nearly fried when hisprison bus is blown up by a jail-breaking arch-bad-guy, and must seek thehelp of journo Charlie Sheen to save him both from the cops who think he'sin with the goons and the scumbag guys themselves. Almost totally unfunny(with real actors Paul Sorvino, Veronica Cartwright and David Warner allwasted), this "comedy" isn't worth a red cent. <B>*1/2</B><p><B>SPHERE (M)</B> - Michael Crichton's connect-the-dots novel is translated to thescreen by director Barry Levinson, who effectively captures the sweatyclaustrophobia of being stuck on the bottom of the Pacific Ocean but justcan't get past the cliches and thorough-going predictability. DustinHoffman, Sharon Stone, Samuel L. Jackson, Liev Schreiber and Peter Coyoteare better actors than usual for this sort of thing, as they assemble inDavey Jones' Locker to study a strange craft that's apparently 300 yearsold and come face-to-face with a shimmering special-effects Sphere thatmakes their deepest fears reality, and Levinson seems to be about to cutthrough with some promise of big thrills indeed (such as what seems to bean approaching giant squid). But then "Jerry" shows up, reveals that all this is in their minds, whichpaves the way for plenty of moralising and intellectualising, and thechance for Levinson to let himself off the hook financially byfrustratingly keeping most of the monstrous creatures expected (animpressive shoal of killer jellyfish aside) implied or imaginary.<p>The cast turn in creditable enough performances, considering what they'vegot to work with, and there are some grisly highlights (gooey tendrilsfished out of a corpse's nose and another body knocking down a fleeingcharacter in a rush of water), but they can't stop the fact that the wholething sinks without a trace with a nebulous punchline that'll leave a curseon your lips. Someone should drown Levinson for that one!!! <B>**1/2</B><p><B>UNDER THE SKIN (R)</B> - Samantha Morton's Iris goes off the rails after thedeath of her Mum (Rita Tushingham) and descends into a squalid,self-destructive world of masochistic near-rape, psychological battery,frequent auto-eroticism and frenetic over-acting in this garbled,poverty-row mess from writer/ director Carine Adler, the sort of horrible,depressing, mentally pulverising experience many will misconstrue asfeminist profundity as they don't have a clue as to anything else it couldpossibly be. Morton tries hard in a role that could have been daring andtaboo-breaking but instead winds up absolutely infuriating. It didn't getUnder My Skin, but it definitely upset my stomach and insulted my mind. <B>**</B><p><B>THE WEDDING SINGER (M)</B> - Adam Sandler's retro-80s comedy doesn't plumb thedepths of his Billy Madison or Happy Gilmore, but that's not for want oftrying. His wedding singer, popular all over town way back in '85 butsuffering a near-breakdown when his own fiance doesn't show for hiswedding, starts to feel longings for a nice waitress (Drew Barrymore) hekeeps bumping into. Unfortunately she's engaged as well (to a nasty guycharacterised mainly by hideously-patterned underpants and a fondness forperving at other girls' backsides), so Sandler has to take a stand. Thereare several anachronisms amidst all the desperate 80s mood-setting (theRubik's Cube, for example, was out of fashion in 1981), and the comedy islow-brow as all get out, but a few cameos (Steve Buscemi and Jon Lovitzdeglamourised mightily) and a jerky gag or two make it less painless andIQ-decreasing than you might think. And, as for Sandler's career - HA! -it'll never last!!! <B>**</B><p><B>THE WOODLANDERS (M)</B> - One of Thomas Hardy's less glum novels gets modesthandling here, with unlikeable leads Rufus Sewell (as Giles) and Emily Woof(!!!) (as Grace) playing out a story of social standing and unrequited lovethat's not quite as depressing as Jude, but which will still bring anyaudience way, way down. Grace returns from a "proper" education alienatedfrom her timber-merchant family, the British working classes and herchildhood sweetheart Giles (Sewell, looking sour), which in turn upsets thecommunity and another lass (Jodhi May) longing for Giles herself. It allleads to misery, not too surprisingly, with a nicely atmospheric evocationof the period lost in the grim and uneventful plotting. Sewell and Woof tryhard, but The Woodlanders is a hard slog that'll leave most audiences stiffas a board. <B>**1/2</B><br clear=all><p><center><hr noshade><A HREF="http://www.electric.on.net"        onMouseOver="waxon('home');        statuson('home'); return true;"        onMouseOut="statusoff(); waxoff('home');        return true;"><IMG name=home SRC="../buttons/butt_home_off.gif" ALT="home" WIDTH="140" HEIGHT="32" BORDER="0"><A HREF="../films/index.html"        onMouseOver="waxon('films');        statuson('films screening'); return true;"        onMouseOut="statusoff(); waxoff('films');        return true;"><IMG name=films SRC="../buttons/butt_films_off.gif" ALT="films screening" WIDTH="140" HEIGHT="32" BORDER="0"></a><hr noshade></center><p><A HREF="http://www.electric.on.net">http://www.electric.on.net</A><p>&copy; This work is subject to copyright.
