The actual frames of the film are almost 10 times the size of conventional 35mm stock so special cameras and projectors are required.<p>The cinema itself does not seem particularly unusual, the rake of seats being much the same as the Nova and Mercury cinemas. The screen is unusually tall, though I believe that height would be the least significant dimension for watching a movie. It is also quite wide, though not as wide as a drive-in and not as curved as the old 70mm screens such as the one in the Regent in the 60s and 70s on which "Star Wars" was first shown. The IMAX certainly does not surround the viewer as the wonderful 180 or 360 degree cinemas do. <p>This latest mutation of the 'magic lantern show’ does not give unobstructed views to the periphery of the vision as I had read. Is this because Adelaide has only the 'economy’ model? The Sydney IMAX is almost twice as tall (eight storeys) and much wider.<p>How important will a format ever really be to a cinematic experience anyway? We all know that it is possible to get totally engrossed and 'drawn in’ to even a tiny black and white tv image if we are interested in the subject being shown. This brings us to the premiere program.<p>The documentary, "Everest", about American climber, Ed Viestur’s fourth ascent of Mount Everest took American IMAX specialist, Greg MacGillivray, eight years to make. The appeal of such an epic subject for the tall screen is obvious.<p>Consider, however, that the camera needed for the IMAX is the biggest and heaviest in the world weighing 16kg. Each 90 sec. roll of film weighs 2.5kg. and, in temperatures of 100 below, it can’t be reloaded with gloves on. As cameraman David Brashears explains, "It takes many people to move the camera and equipment, and it takes time to set up every shot".<p>As this expedition is approximately the thousandth successful ascent and there were a dozen other teams on the summit at the time of shooting, the only point of real interest is the degree of difficulty in making the film. Although there are excellent still and home-video sequences included in this film, we never see a shot of the IMAX camera itself, either being lugged to the most inaccessible place on earth, or being set up.<p>Some macabre plot interest is generated by the deaths of eight climbers from other teams but although we are told that the bodies are encountered frozen because they have to be left where they fell, we don’t actually see them. We do not even see our climbers at any point that looks credibly like the top of the mountain either. The narrator tells us they got there, but surely the least we can expect is a picture of this.<p>There is so much missing from this film that I couldn’t help wishing that each climber had taken a super-8 camera instead. We do see one poor bloke who survives an unsuccessful attempt without his nose and hands due to frostbite, but this just makes it harder to understand the editing policy of the filmakers.<p>The best moments are breath-taking avalanche scenes, mountaineers, walking in spikey snow boots on a flimsy, horizontal, metal ladder over a frightening crevasse, and when the camera is dangled on a rope till I felt sick and had to close my eyes. These great scenes are few and far between and with many scenes obviously shot elsewhere (eg. lower down the mountain), it is an unsatisfactory result alongside recent documentary triumphs such as "Microcosmos" and  "When We were Kings".<p>The Sherpa guide chosen for this expedition is the son of Tensing Norgay who, with Edmund Hillary, was the first to return from the summit in 1953. A movie recreating the first ascent of Everest would have been more feasible and interesting as this film is not sensational enough to be entertaining, nor rigorous enough to be educational.<p>Beatle George Harrison’s reworked "Here Comes the Sun" for the closing credits is a plus as were the occasional elaborate frames around the edge of the screen reminiscent of films from the 1920s.<p>The publicity claims that this project has something to do with "the beauty, wonder and mystery of life itself". The truth is that prior to the arrival of crazy westerners with all their money, the locals had too much respect for the mountain to climb it, and since then, many indigenous guides have died in their service.  The environmental effects of Everest attempts through deforestation and the sheer volume of their litter have also been significant negatives for the Khumbu region. <p>The overall impression is of an ill-conceived "tech-fest" lacking in substance. Another IMAX film,“Thrill Ride” may show the format off to better effect as a virtual roller-coaster, but then again, will it be any match for reality? My IMAX experience didn’t come close to the black and white Buster Keaton with live band that I saw during this year’s Festival. But why not go, just because it’s there.</font> <br clear=all><p><center><hr noshade><A HREF="http://www.electric.on.net"        onMouseOver="waxon('home');        statuson('home'); return true;"        onMouseOut="statusoff(); waxoff('home');        return true;"><IMG name=home SRC="../buttons/butt_home_off.gif" ALT="home" WIDTH="140" HEIGHT="32" BORDER="0"><A HREF="../films/index.html"        onMouseOver="waxon('films');        statuson('films screening'); return true;"        onMouseOut="statusoff(); waxoff('films');        return true;"><IMG name=films SRC="../buttons/butt_films_off.gif" ALT="films screening" WIDTH="140" HEIGHT="32" BORDER="0"></a><hr noshade></center><p><A HREF="http://www.electric.on.net">http://www.electric.on.net</A><p>&copy; This work is subject to copyright.
