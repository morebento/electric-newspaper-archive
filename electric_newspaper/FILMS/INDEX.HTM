between a legendaryoriginal and its sequel (1980 and 1998, although commentators appear tohave forgotten Psycho and Psycho 2's twenty-two year gap), thelong-awaited, much-anticipated, oft-announced Blues Brothers 2000 isn't anembarrassment for amassed cultists, but does suffer from a little too muchsanitisation. <p align=right><font size=-1><a href="03May-05.html">would you like to know

that suicidalspecial (how couldn't it be?), but suffers from exactly the same problem:on a limited but cleverly-utilised budget, Figgis has cast an eclecticgroup of actors, penned a sometimes daring script, imbued everything with ashimmering atmosphere of dark humour, erotic craving and fickle fate, andthen had little or no idea what to do with it all.<p align=right><font size=-1><a

The film's posters and publicity have taken two basic tacks.The first is that the movie has a cast of Scorcese alumni (Robert de Niro,Harvey Keitel, Ray Liotta). The second is that, after years of Rocky andRambo movies and other assorted action fare, Sylvester Stallone is actuallyacting. As with many things in movies, there is an actuarial proof of this:Stallone not only gained weight (evidence of capital-A acting ever since deNiro did it for Raging Bull), but also took a pay cut. <p align=right><font size=-1><a href="27Feb-01.html">would you like to know more?</a></font><p><hr noshade><p><A HREF="http://www.electric.on.net">http://www.electric.on.net</A><p>&copy; This work is subject to copyright.
