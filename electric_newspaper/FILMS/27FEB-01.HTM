The film's posters and publicity have taken two basic tacks.The first is that the movie has a cast of Scorcese alumni (Robert de Niro,Harvey Keitel, Ray Liotta). The second is that, after years of Rocky andRambo movies and other assorted action fare, Sylvester Stallone is actuallyacting. As with many things in movies, there is an actuarial proof of this:Stallone not only gained weight (evidence of capital-A acting ever since deNiro did it for Raging Bull), but also took a pay cut. <p>	These things constitute some kind of empirical proof of quality orworthiness. I wasn't there to see Stallone act, particularly; I was therebecause the cast signalled this as an unambiguous guy film, but one withenough of a cachet of quality that I wouldn't have to spend time defendingit to my tertiary educated mates (thus allowing me to save energy to mounta spirited defence of Starship Troopers). <p>	The audience, at an 11.30 am screening on the first day of release, seemedto be there for largely similar reasons.  A lot of the men might have seenTaxi Driver when it first came out. I felt comfortable with the audience inthis context: they shared a longstanding appreciation of Robert de Niro,and of Harvey Keitel from way before Quentin Tarantino made him an icon forthe new generation of indie filmmakers. <p>	The opening shot of Manhattan managed to be a little novel (it was done atnight), and conveyed an immediate sense of a director happy to betransparently symbolic but not dumb. This was borne out an the scene inwhich Stallone is introduced, playing pinball: (1) the machine insists on"more coins", prefacing the theme of corruption, and (2) Ray Liotta statesthat Stallone is a pinball game kind of guy rather than a video game guy,implying old fashioned values out of step with the times. Stallone is nosaint, though; he unlocks a parking meter to get quarters to feed thepinball machine. <p>	Super Boy, nephew of Ray (Keitel), drives home drunk. Two black youthssideswipe him. He imagines they have a gun, and shoots them dead. Ratherthan face an enquiry, he fakes his suicide at Ray's urgins. Stallone is atime-serving sheriff, whose lifelong ambition to join the NYPD has beenthwarted because of partial deafness, sustained when rescuing a woman froma submerged car in his youth. We see the rescue in flashback. (Cars fallingfrom bridges have associations with political corruption in Americanhistory - Ted Kennedy at Chappaquidick - and in movies, e.g. Blowout.) Hecan't enforce the law, because the cops are a law unto themselves. <p>	Meanwhile,  Liz's husband is having an affair with Ray's wife. Liottaburns down  his own house for insurance - how does Stallone recognise thebomb squad cop?  Super Boy is still alive, but Ray has to rub him out onthe orders of  - the Mob? the police union? This fails, and Super Boy escapes.<p>	Stallone has the hots for cuckolded Liz (Annabella Sciorra, playinglow-key for once), whom he rescued. This is played out to Springsteen'sDrive All Night. The romance never goes further than this, which surelycan't be just because it would be adulterous; it's nice to see a movie notderailed by a gratuitous romantic/sexual subplot. <p>	Liz's husband (Peter Berg, from The Last Seduction) threatens to rat onhis mates, so they let him die when confronting a criminal. Stallone triesto right a wrong, at the urging of I.A. guy de Niro (lots of familiarsmiles and tics at first - the hand held palm down as a sign of hisauthority, but the performance settles down).<p>	Much has been made of the claim that Stallone does some "real acting" inthis film. The weight gain helps, actually, in that Stallone looks thepart, like a regular guy whose vestiges of unexpected physical beauty hintat how much better his life might have been. He evokes a sense of sadnessand lost opportunities quite effectively, his romantic scenes are wiselyrestrained, and his transition to gun-toting hero doesn't have quite thesense of inevitability and artifice that accompanies Clint Eastwood'stransformation at the end of Unforgiven. Best of all, he doesn't shout a lot. Pretty much everyone else shouts sooner or later, 'cause that's what peoplepay to see Keitel, Liotta, etc do. <p>	My favourite scene is that in which Stallone and Annabella Sciorra fumblearound the edges of romance while Bruce Springsteen's Stolen Car plays on aturntable.  Aspiring slacker film makers take note: in the featured songsdepartment, James Mangold has shown the way. <p><hr noshade><p><A HREF="http://www.electric.on.net">http://www.electric.on.net</A><p>&copy; This work is subject to copyright.
