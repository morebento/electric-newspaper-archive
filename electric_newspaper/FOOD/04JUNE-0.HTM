On a recommendation, Randy and partner, joined by another couple,foolishly arrived one recent, chilly, Friday night without a booking.<p>"I'm sorry, but we're always booked out on Friday and Saturday nights,"lamented the mature-age waitress. <p>A combination of disappointment, hunger and the cold must have radiatedfrom thefrustrated foursome.<p>"Wait here and I'll see what I can do," she offered with a smile.<p>In a spirit of "can do" which would shame most of the trendy "attitude"cafes around town, the waitress enlisted the help of a fellow employee,rustled up a spare table and chairs and squeezed the newly-arriveds inbetween two existing tables.<p>Pretty impressive considering the pressure the staff was under to wait onthe full house.<p>What followed was equally impressive. To avoid minutiae, let it just be saidthat the two couples three-coursed their way through faultlessly presentedand prepared cuisine, together with beer and house wine, for around $30 ahead.<p>Randy reckoned he had hit the jackpot with his main course of smoked salmonsalad, layered with eggplant tempura and covered with a raita sauce. Knownfar and wide for his ability to "put it away", Randy struggled to finish theextra-generous serving and wondered aloud if the chef had a salmon farmattached to the kitchen.<p>With its pokies parlour tucked discreetly behind the fully carpeted, diningarea, The Excelsior provided a surprisingly tranquil dining environment andone which attracted a diverse socio-economic group of patrons. <p>Icing on the cake was provided by friendly staff who, despite their RoadRunner-like footwork between kitchen and tables, made regular visits to thequartet to check that everything was in order.<p>In a rare gesture by Randy, he left a $5 tip in recognition not only of highquality service and cuisine, but also the extraordinary effort made toaccommodate four people who should have known better.<p>Cut to the following week. A Thursday night. Randy and partner were hostingan old friend visiting from Hobart, together with his brother. They decidedthat, based upon their recent, successful, suburban hotel experience, itwould be a good idea to point the compass in the opposite direction and taketheir Tasmanian companions to a cosy, eastern suburbs pub.<p>Randy's partner suggested the Maylands. She said the reputation of the Clappisfamily's Italian food preceded them. Done.<p>Entering the warm, earthy, dining room there was a sense of anticipationabout aconvivial night to be shared among good friends over good food. Only thedearth of patrons - just two other groups of diners - lessened the atmosphere.<p>Randy and co. were briefly greeted by a young waitress who pointed towardsthe bar to order food and drinks. She then pointed towards the table areaand directed them to sit there, like a railway porter indicating the correctplatform.<p>Drinks were self-service order at the bar. The menus were produced onlyafter the waitress noticed the party's collective eyestrain caused by thedistant blackboard list. It was to be her last meaningful encounter with thefoursome for some time.<p>After ordering at the front bar, a basket bearing warm bread was deliveredby another staffer, but there were no plates or cutlery. One of thevisitors, displaying traditional, Tasmanian, pioneering spirit, venturedforth and found knives and plates beneath the distant blackboard.<p>The four diners then suddenly realised they were competing for the one, tinybutter dish which accompanied the bread basket. It held the equivalent ofone pat of butter. With the bread losing its heat and no staff to be seen,Randy took the law into his own hands, strode to the kitchen and, in hisbest Oliver Twist voice, asked the milling hands for some more butter.<p>"Not a problem", came the reply. Randy returned victorious. Patrons 1. Staffnil.<p>The cavalry then arrived in the shape of Hardy's Insignia Cabernet SauvignonShiraz. It was to be the best spent $18.50 of the night. The red wine, openfire and warm surroundings soothed the group until food arrived.<p>Randy's double-take did not get past his partner who, intimately knowing MrDiner's demeanour, looked down at his lamb and potato curry and smelt a rat.<p>The small dish contained five pieces of lamb which would each fit neatlyonto a 50 cent piece. It was accompanied by one cup of dryish, cooked rice.At $13.50, Randy could not help feeling it was he and not the lamb which hadbeen fleeced.<p>The Bass Strait emigrants fared better in the portion stakes, but the freshsalads which the menu said would accompany their meals did not arrive withthe meal.<p>Staff were either resting from the strain of waiting on three tables or wereperhaps ducking out to keep an eye on NYPD Blue - whatever the reason theywere as accessible as a Friday night parking space in Gouger Street.<p>By the time our original waitress appeared, was reminded about the salads'non-arrival and returned with them, the Tasmanians had finished their mains.<p>Their politeness in the face of very ordinary mainland hospitality made thestaff's indifference towards the night's sloppiness all the moreinsufferable. <p>For the record, it must be said that the food was agreeable. Randy's partnerordered kranske - two sausages which came with beetroot, cranberries,pickled goodies and vegetables as a side order. Although tasty, she thoughtthat at $11.90 they were a bit pricey for glorified pub bangers. Randybegged to differ. <p>Suffice to say the party did not stay for coffee. They all agreed NorthAdelaideseemed safer.<p>Adelaide is a tough market for eatery owners. If the Maylands operators cancompete with all those other hungry hotels which have renovated theirkitchens and upgraded their menus then good luck to them. But indifferentservice, highish prices, cut corners and servings dished out by the portionpolice is pushing your luck.<p>The moral of Randy's suburban sojourns? Go west!<br clear=all><p><a target=new href="http://www.webfood.com.au"><img src="../ads/webfood.gif" width=450 height=81 alt=webfood border=0></a><p><CENTER><hr noshade><A HREF="../index.html"        onMouseOver="waxon('home');        statuson('home'); return true;"        onMouseOut="statusoff(); waxoff('home');        return true;"><IMG name=home SRC="../buttons/butt_home_off.gif" ALT="home" WIDTH="140" HEIGHT="32" BORDER="0"></a><A HREF="index.html"        onMouseOver="waxon('food');        statuson('food'); return true;"        onMouseOut="statusoff(); waxoff('food');        return true;"><IMG name=food SRC="../buttons/butt_food_off.gif" ALT="food" WIDTH="140" HEIGHT="32" BORDER="0"></a><hr noshade></CENTER><p><A HREF="http://www.electric.on.net">http://www.electric.on.net</A><p>&copy; This work is subject to copyright.
