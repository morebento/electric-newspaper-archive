If you cancount a winemaker's worth in terms of medals and trophies, StephenJohn is up there with the best.  He amassed for Seppelts and WolfBlass an enviable number of gold medals and awards, and his record of ninegold medals in one wine show (as White Wine Maker for Wolf Blass)remains unbeaten.<p><IMG SRC="21July/HG2107M1.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="142" HEIGHT="92" BORDER="0" HSPACE="3" VSPACE="3">In 1994, Stephen and his wife purchased a six hectare vineyard justoutside Watervale, and established a winery with a view to producingsmall volumes of high class table wines with distinctive varietalcharacteristics.  Stephen John offers a range of six wines, alldistinctively different, and elegant wines every one.<p>The Watervale Riesling is fresh and clean from start to finish, withthat rainwater-purity of taste Watervale rieslings are known for.  Forthose who enjoy aged whites, this one will cellar for up to ten yearsand can be expected to produce soft toasty characters that will rewarda long wait.  (Although the frequent practice is to drink white winesyoung, Clare Valley wine makers in particular will encourage you tokeep your rieslings to develop a little bottle age.   Drinking an agedriesling is a different experience, but something you should try.) <p><IMG SRC="21July/HG2107M3.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="142" HEIGHT="93" BORDER="0" HSPACE="3" VSPACE="3">When he purchased the property, Stephen John found a planting of oldPedro Ximinez vines, dating back to 1926.  He uses these to make asoft, lightly oaked, dry wine that has a silky mouthfeel, issurprisingly weighty in the mouth, but full of clean herbaceousflavours. <p>Pedro Ximinez originated in Spain, and vines were brought to Watervalein the very early years of settlement.  Although less well known tothe average wine drinker today, it is a variety with a long history."When I was with Wolf Blass at Quelltaler," said Stephen John, "OurQuelltaler Hock was the biggest selling wine in Australia.  It wasmade exclusively from Pedro Ximinez grapes.  At one time, PedroXiminez was the grape that was used for Great Western Champagne."<p>"There has been some confusion in the consumer mind between the tastesof oaked and unoaked Chardonnays," remarked Stephen John. "Currently,there seems to be a shift toward lighter, softer styles, less wood andmore fruit.  Clare is not an area highly recognised for Chardonnays;it hasn't ever produced big-flavoured styles."  His own Chardonnay islight, with very little wood, redolent of melon and citrus with aclean sharp finish.   <p><IMG SRC="21July/HG2107M4.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="142" HEIGHT="96" BORDER="0" HSPACE="3" VSPACE="3">Stephen John  Shiraz is much in demand amongst cellar door customers.Sourced from dry-grown vines on the estate and elsewhere in the area,the '96 is a medium bodied wine, a clear purple-red colour with grassynotes, hints of spice and musky violets.  Soft and velvety, it is avery approachable wine.<p>The Cabernet Sauvignon is made from low-cropping vines on the estate,and matured in French oak.  It has a firm tannin structure and richberry fruit, and while it is extremely enjoyable now it will benefitfrom some bottle age, so buy it and hide it from yourself for a fewyears.<p>Stephen John's biggest seller is his sparkling burgundy, TraugottCuvee, named after an ancestor who gloried in the name Traugott John.A blend of shiraz and pinot noir, Traugott Cuvee has a deep garnet hueand fills the mouth with luscious berry fruit and a soft yeasty bead.Delicious!<p>Stephen John offered some thoughts on making and drinking wine.  "Iprefer to drink reds myself.  When I really want to enjoy life I turnto a cabernet with some bottle age,"  he said.  "Reds are easier tomake, too.  White wine making is more technically demanding.  You haveless time to get it right."<p>For Stephen John, discipline is an important aspect of wine making.He said, "You can't beat the training and experience you get workingfor a big firm. Making wines to order, making them to a syle, is greattraining.  I'm now able to enjoy the luxury of making wines that Ienjoy. Young aspiring wine makers who come up here sometimes say thisis the kind of operation they'd like to work in.  But if you start outas a winemaker with a small winery, that's all you'll ever be.  Workfor a big company, gain some experience, you can go anywhere."<p><FONT SIZE="-1">* Stephen John Wines is located at Watervale in the Clare Valley, andis open to the public weekdays, weekends and public holidays.</FONT><br clear=all><p><a target=new href="http://www.webfood.com.au"><img src="../ads/webfood.gif" width=450 height=81 alt=webfood border=0></a><p><CENTER><hr noshade><A HREF="../index.html"        onMouseOver="waxon('home');        statuson('home'); return true;"        onMouseOut="statusoff(); waxoff('home');        return true;"><IMG name=home SRC="../buttons/butt_home_off.gif" ALT="home" WIDTH="140" HEIGHT="32" BORDER="0"></a><A HREF="index.html"        onMouseOver="waxon('food');        statuson('food'); return true;"        onMouseOut="statusoff(); waxoff('food');        return true;"><IMG name=food SRC="../buttons/butt_food_off.gif" ALT="food" WIDTH="140" HEIGHT="32" BORDER="0"></a><hr noshade></CENTER><p><A HREF="http://www.electric.on.net">http://www.electric.on.net</A><p>&copy; This work is subject to copyright.
