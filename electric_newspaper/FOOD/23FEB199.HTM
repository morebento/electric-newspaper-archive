That is the question. Random Diner has askedhimself on many an occasion after receiving less than adequate fare, serviceor value at some of Adelaide's 800 restaurants and cafes.<p>When average fare is moderately priced, it seems churlish to protest.Equally harsh if the service is off at a "cheapy". But if you are payingprices which imply good food and service, then, according to Randy's law,let the proprietor beware should standards be unreasonable.<p>The following account may provide impetus to fellow diners to help providewhat Randy calls a Culinary Conscience for Adelaide. <p>Randy and partner joined a party of diners for a Chinese New Year banquet inAdelaide's Beijing Restaurant. Only nine of the promised 12 courses arrivedduring the course of the evening and in minuscule quantities for the tableof 10. One small dish - a spoonful per person - constituted each course.<p>With every table packed and staff literally fast-stepping to service thecrowd, Randy's concerns about a shortfall in dishes roused neither employeesnor fellow dining party members - the latter preferring to adopt the famousAustralian "no worries" motto and not interfere with the spirit of theChinese New Year festivities. <p>No-one could reasonably complain about the quality of the food (standard OzChinese cuisine) but at $33 a head, the normally reasonable Randy was, bynight's end, feeling short-changed and hungry!<p>Two days later, having debated the "complain or not to" question with hisconscience, Randy decided to contact the restaurant to express hisdisappointment at what he felt had been a devalued dining experience.<p>"Where were you sitting?" asked the spokesman in a tone which brought tomind the prosecutorial zeal of the Spanish Inquisition. Randy politelyreplied that the geographical location of his mealtime misadventure shouldbear no relation to a 25 per cent rate of non-arrival for promised and paidfor courses. Randy further explained that a friend had made the booking andthus he did not want to reveal the location and risk embarrassing the friend.<p>The restaurant man added, without addressing the absence of food issue, thatthe $33 fixed-price banquet was very reasonable given the inclusion ofentertainment. True. A dragon dance did punctuate the evening, ending withthe dancers making the round of tables asking for money from diners. <p>Declining to say where he had been seated Randy gave his own name and contacttelephone number, reiterating that it was his (Randy's) complaint, not thatof anyone else at his table. <p>Two days later, one of Randy's fellow diners (who also complained to Randyon the night about having left hungry) called. She reported that theirmutual friend and host was very embarrassed about Randy's complaint!<p>Huh?<p>The proprietorial prosecutor had rung every person who had made a booking onthat night and asked if a person by the name of Random Diner had been attheir table.<p>He inevitably located Randy's friend and host and relayed Randy's complaint- nothing more. Randy was dumbstruck by the restaurant man's motives andmodus-operandi, not to mention annoyed by the unnecessary involvement of hisfriend in a straightforward, one-on-one, consumer-to-business complaint.<p>Having been alerted to the embarrassing escalation of his initial queryabout not getting all the course for the banquet, Randy called theproprietor again. "Now that you know where I was sitting and who I was with,how does that help you deal with my complaint?" he asked. The proprietor'sresponse was to hang up.<p>So what's the moral of this account?<p>Randy does not moralise, but he does know he will never return to dine atthe Beijing.<p>He also recommends that far from being cowered by the aforementioned account,diners bear their share of responsibility for attaining a high quality ofoverall restaurant service in Adelaide by making proprietors aware of badexperiences. It is then up to the owners to act as they see fit.<p>To balance the equation, Randy can report that just such a complaint (ahalf-hour wait for the bill after twice requesting it) to the co-proprietorof the Cactus Mexican Cafe in Rundle Street received a courteous andprofessional response. After verifying the staff problem, she offered anapology and a complimentary Margarita for Randy and his guest.<p>When Randy next appears for you, prepare yourself for a bullet-proof diningexperience. A low profile, city restaurant which consistently meets thechallenge of impeccable performance for that "special" night when money isless important than the aftertaste.<p><a target=new href="http://www.webfood.com.au"><img src="../ads/webfood.gif" width=450 height=81 alt=webfood border=0></a><p><hr noshade><p><A HREF="http://www.electric.on.net">http://www.electric.on.net</A><p>&copy; This work is subject to copyright.
