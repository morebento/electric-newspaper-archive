I joined some      sixty other eager tasters at the Fleurieu Visitors' Centre on the      outskirts of McLaren Vale.     <p>     We had before us on the tasting table samples of four wines.  These      were the four batches of shiraz destined, in some combination, to      become the latest Reserve Shiraz.  We were invited to taste all four      and compare notes.     <p>     Each batch yielded up its own characteristics.  One big and fruity,      one redolent of bitter chocolate and licorice... What would be the      optimal combination in which to blend them?  Argument bounced back and      forth about the likely result of blending a lot of this with a little      of that.     <p>     Divided into teams, we blended up small batches according to our best      guesses and tasted the results. Team members with a scientific bent      and a steady hand handled the measuring beaker. The white linen      tablecloths took on a mottled purple and maroon appearance.  Teeth and      tongues turned bluish black.     <p>     It's extraordinary how combining three or four fairly straightforward      components can result in complex and surprising tastes that differ so      markedly from the sum of their parts.     <p>     The pinnacle of the evening was a `blind tasting' of the blends      created by all six teams, with a vote for the most popular.     <p>     This exercise has been repeated at similar gatherings across Australia      in the lead-up to blending time.  I asked Sparky Marquis how much      notice they took of the results.  He replied that they take them very      seriously.  The exercise results in a vast cross-section of different      tastes and preferences, but no matter how educated the palate, there      was a fair amount of agreement amongst people about the style they      liked.  The results from these `Friends' blending sessions would      indeed inform the work to be done at the Fox Creek tasting bench.     <p>     Sparky - who can't be described as a retiring character - takes the      view that many hands are responsible for a good wine.  "Good wine      comes from the vineyard," he said.  "Even the most fantastic wine      makers have to start with good grapes.  Anybody with a real passion      for wine could make the wines we make, with the fruit we have.  We      must be the luckiest wine makers in Australia."     <p>     His enthusiasm for the high quality grapes was a tribute to his      brother in law Paul Watts, vineyard manager at Fox Creek.  Conscious      of the contribution a fine raw material makes in the process, Paul      Watts has set about establishing optimum conditions for cultivating      his vineyards and oversees the quality of the product with an eagle      eye.     <p>     Fox Creek's Reserve Shiraz has been its flagship wine from the start.       "We reckon the '96 was the best wine we've ever made," said Sparky      Marquis.  "It was the runner up in last year's Jimmy Watson; it won      Judge's Choice and Consumer's Choice for a '96 Shiraz in Winestate."      <p>     And the '97?  Sparky and Sarah are confident it will be as good, if      not better.     <p>     What will it taste like?  Some of the blends that were being passed      around at the Fleurieu Visitors Centre were pretty tasty.  The      potential is huge.  Add in Sarah's subtle judgement and Sparky's firm      skill and the result will be magic.     <p>     Good components made from good grapes, blended with care and skill and      talent.  What more could you want?  The '97 Reserve Shiraz is coming      soon.  Watch your wine merchant's shelves.<br clear=all><p><a target=new href="http://www.webfood.com.au"><img src="../ads/webfood.gif" width=450 height=81 alt=webfood border=0></a><p><CENTER><hr noshade><A HREF="../index.html"        onMouseOver="waxon('home');        statuson('home'); return true;"        onMouseOut="statusoff(); waxoff('home');        return true;"><IMG name=home SRC="../buttons/butt_home_off.gif" ALT="home" WIDTH="140" HEIGHT="32" BORDER="0"></a><A HREF="index.html"        onMouseOver="waxon('food');        statuson('food'); return true;"        onMouseOut="statusoff(); waxoff('food');        return true;"><IMG name=food SRC="../buttons/butt_food_off.gif" ALT="food" WIDTH="140" HEIGHT="32" BORDER="0"></a><hr noshade></CENTER><p><A HREF="http://www.electric.on.net">http://www.electric.on.net</A><p>&copy; This work is subject to copyright.
