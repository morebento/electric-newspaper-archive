Backbenchers argue that it produces betterpolitical benefits than the more broad approach of tinkering with thetax scales.	The package, which still has no firm launching date, will also affectthe multi-billion-dollar sporting industry, with Australia's 30,000sporting clubs to be subjected to a GST on sponsorship deals, entry feesand memberships.	Government sources have confirmed that sport will be taxed under theGST, raising about $100 million, despite Cabinet's decision to excludecharities and churches.	In other areas:	<ul>	<li> The tourism industry will be helped by substantial funding foroverseas promotions following the decision to apply the GST to packagessold offshore.	<li> The sale of existing homes will not be taxed, but new homes will befully taxed, forcing the Government to offer some relief for first-homebuyers. Real estate agents' fees and legal fees for both types ofpurchases will be fully taxed.	<li> Local government rates and services will be fully taxed, a muchtougher position than in Fightback, which only taxed services.	<li> The Deputy Prime Minister, Mr Fischer, confirmed that the Governmentwould replace diesel excise with a lower road user charge, reducing thetax burden on road transport. The excise on petrol would remain.	<li> The gaming industry will be face an indirect GST burden, while alsopaying more than $3 billion in tax to the States. Gaming will be"input-taxed", which means the GST applies to inputs while not applyingdirectly to the cost of gambling.</ul>	A poll commissioned by business to assess the results of its $4 millionadvertising campaign supporting a GST has shown that 60 per cent ofvoters would consider a GST if personal income rates were lowered.[The Sydney Morning Herald]<p><hr noshade><p><B><font size=+1>POLLSTER SEES GST AS COALITION 'SUICIDE'</font></b><p>	Pollster Gary Morgan yesterday forecast electoral doom for the FederalGovernment saying Labor would "walk it in" because the Coalition was"committing suicide" by pushing a goods and services tax.	Speaking at a retail industry lunch in Melbourne, the head of RoyMorgan Research was asked the percentage rate at which a GST was likelyto be pegged.	"You won't have any per cent because you won't have a GST", Mr Morgansaid.	"I think the Liberal Party is committing suicide.  They're down atabout 33 per cent and going south."	But other prominent pollsters said Mr Morgan's judgments were toopremature, because the tax package had not been released.	Mr Morgan also forecast that Pauline Hanson's One Nation Party wouldpick up 10 to 15 per cent of the popular vote.[The Australian]<p><hr noshade><p><B><font size=+1>MLC THREATENS OLSEN'S ETSA STRATEGY</font></b><p>	John Olsen's leadership took a bruising blow yesterday when a key UpperHouse MP said he could block crucial power privatisation legislationafter losing "trust and confidence" in the Government's integrity.	Nick Xenophon, the nation's sole No Pokies MP, issued a scathingcritique of Mr Olsen's failure last week to discipline senior ministerGraham Ingerson for deliberately misleading Parliament.	Mr Xenophon said the Government's credibility had been "materiallyundermined" over the Ingerson affair and voters were disgusted at theGovernemnt's "cumulative conduct" which had set a "dangerous andcorrosive precedent" for future governments.	He felt a "growing sense of disquiet" with the Government's handling ofthe power sale, including its $300,000 advertising campaign and thehiring of spin doctors to do its work.	Mr Xenophon's attack underlines the high price the Premier is payingfor his loyalty to Mr Ingerson, whose ministerial behaviour nowthreatens the Government's central budget strategy - the proposed $5billion-plus sale of power utilities ETSA and Optima Energy.	"Unless the Premier acts decisively in the immediate future to remedythe obvious damage to the reputation of his Government .. I will find itincreasingly difficult to accept at face value the Government's case onthe proposed sale of ETSA", Mr Xenophon said.	Without Mr Xenophon's vote the sale legislation is effectivelydoomed.   Supporters of former premier Dean Brown say Mr Olsen'sleadership could not survive such a policy defeat.[The Australian]<p><hr noshade><p><B><font size=+1>$114BN IN EXPORTS AS TRADERS FIND WAY AROUND ASIAN CRISIS</font></b><p>	Australian exporters have successfully diversified their overseasmarkets to compensate for weak demand in Asia, according to new tradefigures published yesterday.	The Australian Bureau of Statistics figures show exports to key Asiancustomers fell by about 3 per cent in the first six months of 1998compared with the first six months of 1997. 	But exports to all other countries, notably the US and the EuropeanUnion, rose by 21 per cent over the same period, which resulted in arecord overall performance by Australian exporters in June. 	Australia exported just under $10 billion worth of goodsand services in June, and $114 billion over the entire 1997-98 financialyear, after seasonal adjustment. 	The ABS figures also show Australia's trade balance deteriorated from adeficit of $536 million in May to a deficit of $920 million in Juneafter adjustment for seasonal factors. 	The trade data buoyed the Australian dollar, with the local currencysettling for the day marginally firmer at US61.27¢, from US61.13¢. 	But there are still conflicting signs about where the Australianeconomy is heading, with a survey released yesterday suggesting thatbusiness investment is weakening. 	The Investment Monitor  prepared by Access Economics and DeltaElectricity shows investment projects under construction increased by aweak 3.2 per cent over the past year. "The survey thus suggests thatindustrial business investment is slowing," said an Access Economicsdirector, Dr Ed Shann. 	Analysts were encouraged by the latest trade data, which was in linewith market expectations, with some private-sectoreconomists now claiming the worst of the Asian crisis could be over forAustralian exporters. 	The 7.4 per cent seasonally adjusted increase in imports in June wasalso taken by analysts as an indication of considerable resilience indomestic demand, an important component of economic growth. [The Australian Financial Review]<p><hr noshade><p><B><font size=+1>CLINTON TO TESTIFY</font></b><p>	President Bill Clinton has come to an agreement to providetestimony for Independent Counsel Ken Starr's grand jury.        The president's lawyer, David Kendall, announced that Clintonwill submit to questioning on Aug. 17.        The testimony will be videotaped at the White House andClinton's lawyers will be present for the questioning. 	"In an effort to achieve a prompt resolution of this entire matter thepresident will voluntarily provide his testimony on August 17, 1998 tothe Office of Independent Counsel, as he has on prior occasions,"Kendall said. 	The White House also confirmed the president did receive a subpoena onJuly 17 to appear before the grand jury. Now that the lawyers havereached an agreement for the president to voluntarily testify, thatsubpoena has been withdrawn. 	Sources are also telling CNN that the president's testimony will comeafter Monica Lewinsky begins her appearance at the grand jury. 	The deal between Kendall and Starr also stipulates that there will onlybe one day of questioning at the White House. 	The agreement comes on the heels of news that Lewinsky is prepared totestify that she and Clinton discussed how to conceal their allegedsexual relationship, sources say. 	Lewinsky's account Starr's prosecutors is that "she and the presidentwere talking about cover stories for their relationship, as two peoplein such situations frequently do; how to keep it secret," one sourcesaid.[CNN] <p><hr noshade><p><B><font size=+1>TOUR de FRANCE CHAOS                   </font></b><p>	The Tour de France has been thrown into chaos with world number oneLaurent Jalabert withdrawing and other riders conducting a go-slowprotest.	The move delayed the end of the 17th stage from Albertville toAix-les-Bains by several hours.	It was the riders way of complaining about what they say is theheavy-handed nature of a police investigation into drug use.	The stage has been declared null and void.	Earlier police had searched the hotel rooms of one of Jalabert'sformer teams for the second time in two days.[ABC News]<p><hr noshade><p><B><font size=+1>FINANCE : DOW LOWEST IN A MONTH</font></b><p><PRE>		All Ords	2693	-33		Dow Jones	8914	-19		FTSE-100	5844	+8		$ Aust		61.25 US cents		$ Aust		37.25 UK pence		Gold (London)	$289.70 per oz.		Gold (New York) $289.90 per oz.</PRE><p><hr noshade><p><B><font size=+1>WEATHER :  BECOMING FINE</font></b><p><PRE>		Thursday  Risk of a shower 13		Friday	  Fine 14		Saturday  Fine 14		Sunday    Cloudy periods 14</PRE><p><center><img losrc="http://www.electric.on.net/graphics/w.gif" src="http://www.electric.on.net/ads/Rob_Roy_3.gif" width=390 height=80 alt="The Rob Roy Hotel"></center><p><CENTER><hr noshade><A HREF="http://www.electric.on.net"        onMouseOver="waxon('home');        statuson('home'); return true;"        onMouseOut="statusoff(); waxoff('home');        return true;"><IMG name=home SRC="../buttons/butt_home_off.gif" ALT="home" WIDTH="140" HEIGHT="32" BORDER="0"></a><hr noshade></CENTER><p><FORM ACTION="http://www.cobweb.com.au/cgi-bin/ads/clickthru.pl" METHOD="POST"><input type=hidden name="recipient" value="chris@cobweb.com.au"><input type=hidden name="env_report" value="REMOTE_HOST,HTTP_USER_AGENT,REMOTE_ADDR"><input type=hidden name="sort" value="order:subject,env_report"><input type=hidden name="redirect" value="http://www.cobweb.com.au/services"><input type=hidden name="subject" value="somebody clicked on the wide Cobweb ad - DIGEST"><INPUT TYPE="image" src="http://www.electric.on.net/ads/cobweb_wide.gif" width=460 height=60 alt="Cobweb Internet Services" border=1></form><p><A HREF="http://www.electric.on.net">http://www.electric.on.net</A><p>&copy; This work is subject to copyright.
