Late in '96 and early in '97 I raised concerns publicly throughthe print and electronic media about the reduction of emergencyaccommodation beds by the Salvos and Vinnies in Whitmore Sq. My commentswere challenged and misrepresented by colleauges in both the government andnon-government.<p>The criticisms came from colleagues adverse to commenting on activities ofthe religious organisations involved. After trying to hush up the changes,the Salvos and Vinnies had to come clean and claimed that the homelesswould not be disadvantaged through the reduction of beds - an unbelievableclaim they maintain in Mr. Warrens' story. There is nothing sinister inthis plan of closing down the only option for many homeless people, it'sabout backing winners. I made that point when beds where reduced, andmaintain it now during the total closure of emergency accommodation.<p>There is nothing sexy about emergency accommodation; however it is all somefolks can cope with during episodes of home!lessness. The transformation ofarrangements for these people from 70 emergency beds in Whitmore Squaredown to 10 beds, for up to nine weeks (with conditions), at the other endof town, doesn't come across as a solution to the ever-increasing amount ofhomeless persons.<p>Where will they go after their nine weeks are up? Nowhere! You can't breakthe cycle these people are in, in just nine  weeks. Someone has to fight onbehalf of these people, as their situation makes it difficult for them. Iwonder what my ex-colleagues are saying now?<p>Phil Harrison,<br>Woodville West<p><hr noshade><p ALIGN=RIGHT><font size=-1><a href="#send_a_letter">Do you want to send a letter?</a></font><p><font size=-1>Friday July 24, 1998</font><p><B><font size=+2>Hypothetical</font></b><p>Was Graham Ingerson required to attend detention class, assigned additionalhomework or instructed to write on the board one hundred times "I must notmislead Parliament"?<p>David Mills<br>Adelaide<p><hr noshade><p ALIGN=RIGHT><font size=-1><a href="#send_a_letter">Do you want to send a letter?</a></font><p><font size=-1>Monday July 20, 1998</font><p><B><font size=+2>Lost on earth</font></b><p>I am doing family history and I am looking for Kenneth James and PatriciaCoombs nee Farquhar, there last known address was Queenstown.<p>Sharon Joseph<br><A HREF="mailto:sharonj@hypermax.net.au">sharonj@hypermax.net.au</A><br>Adelaide<p><hr noshade><p ALIGN=RIGHT><font size=-1><a href="#send_a_letter">Do you want to send a letter?</a></font><p><font size=-1>Friday July 17, 1998</font><p><B><font size=+2>Dancin' the State away</font></b><p>Incredulously, I watch as one of the country's most respected dancedirectors and choreographers is  sent packing by  "the board".  <p>Sack the board I say!  <p>What vision.  Only a few months ago, in  the post '98 Festival of artseuphoria, there was positive talk of a "culture led recovery".  And nowthis!  <p>The forces of smallmindedness and parochialism have triumphed yet again indiminishing this State and its creative base. It's no wonder that peopleare leaving the place in droves.<p>What about a bit of initiative.  What about attracting more world classperformers to augment the base that ADT provides, instead of cutting downwhat we have got?ADT will soon earn a reputation not as a world class act but as a companywithout a future. <p>Jack Hoogland<br>Myrtle Park<p><hr noshade><p ALIGN=RIGHT><font size=-1><a href="#send_a_letter">Do you want to send a letter?</a></font><p><font size=-1>Thursday July 16, 1998</font><p><B><font size=+2>For richer and for poorer</font></b><p>I think it's a bit rich for the Real Estate Institute calling for the saleof ETSA, as reported in The Electric Newspaper this week.<p>The institute said ETSA should be sold to bring down State debt. It arguedagainst State debt, saying it was vital that the State received a AAAcredit rating.<p>I would like to ask the Real Estate Institute who can afford to buy a housewithout going into debt. Nobody! So here we have the institute arguing thaton the one hand the State, which is all of us citizens in common, shouldnot have any assets if we owe money on them, but that the institute'scustomers - homebuyers - are quite different. According to the institute,we common folk should buy bigger and better houses, go into debt, and keepthe real estate agents in wealth - but the State should flog its assets andkeep the multi-national power companies in wealth.<p>It's a bullshit argument. No one should take the real estate instituteseriously.<p>Paul Nevarthal<br>Adelaide<p><hr noshade><p ALIGN=RIGHT><font size=-1><a href="#send_a_letter">Do you want to send a letter?</a></font><p><font size=-1>Wednesday July 15, 1998</font><p><B><font size=+2>View from the Hill</font></b><p>I'd like to reassure fellow Electric Newspaper readers that mycontributions, when addressing political issues, are my views and my viewsonly.

On the contrary it remains the most authoritative analysis on theissue.<p>In my research I addressed the reasons the Government had given to justifysale i.e. loss of competition payments, the risks of the NationalElectricity Market, and retiring of State debt.  At no stage did Iinterrogate lobbyists as to their positions on the philosophy ofprivatisation, nor would it have been appropriate.  The correct processalways was to look at the arguments given by the Government and test them:ultimately, on each point the Government's arguments foundered.<p>What is more puzzling about the Davis opinion piece is that he repeats theclaims made in stage-managed and distorted questions and answers which hehas asked of the Treasurer in Parliament.  For the record, the document wehanded out to journalists at the time of announcement of our decision tooppose the sale was 10 pages long plus a cover sheet and appendices.<p>Sadly, Mr Davis has demonstrated that he does not appear to know thedifference between ETSA and Optima in his piece dated 6/7/98, when herefers to ETSA dividends and uses a quote from the Treasurer about OptimaEnergy dividends to prove his point.  <p>(Please note Legh - Optima produces the electricity at its power stations,ETSA delivers it via the poles and wires.  Each provides a separate revenuestream to the State Government.  You really should try not to confuse them.)<p>This is matter which must be resolved on substance, and despite Legh Davis'debating points and the Government's desperate attempts to save face,ultimately their arguments just do not stack up.<p>Sandra Kanck<br>Deputy Leader, Australian Democrats<p><hr noshade><p ALIGN=RIGHT><font size=-1><a href="#send_a_letter">Do you want to send a letter?</a></font><p><font size=-1>Monday July 6, 1998</font><p><B><font size=+2>It's a date!</font></b><p>Checking the headlines is a high priority in my daily routine and I do likethe range and perspectives you publish.<p>Given that you sensibly leave significant articles on the front page for afew days and also that you archive them for ready access it would help me alot if you were to include the date that it is written at the head of eachabstract, possibly as part of the link to the full article.

Hardcopy newspapers are difficult to get here and expensive when they areavailable but internet sevrices such as yours provides up to date news inan easily readable format and at a reasonable price.<p>One query I have is that I also access other newspapers on the net (it'snot difficult to work out what other Adelaide paper I have limited accessto) and when you back track from a story to the main index, the other paperis almost instantaneous whilst The Electric Newspaper seems to need toreload everything and it takes more time to get back to the index.<p>All the best, keep up the good work and I look forward to seeing morepictures if and when the affordable technology is available.<p>Susan and Peter Morris<br>High Wycombe<br>London UK<p><i>Thanks for the suggestions.

We're stillshooting a mixture of digital and 35mm at the moment, and moving graduallytowards full digital. The costs of 35mm have been an accountant'snightmare, but the digital cameras we've tried have been a bit limitedoptically for news work. We hope soon to get our hands on a new digitalwhich largely overcomes these limitations, and we've accepted the services(!) of a second photographer who will help improve our coverage.<p>The Team<br>(p.s.

Why has Adelaide been beset by such crap politicians on bothsides of the political spectrum, that for over 10 years South Australia hasbeen sliding into the mire?<p>My personal highlights have been:<p><ul><li> selling the income-producing side of the State Bank.<li> general Government asset stripping (selling anything that generates, orhas the potential to generate, profits is not the act of a balanced mind -particularly when the money realised is used to pay debts rather thancreate another source of income.<li> watching the manufacturing sector slide into virtual oblivion whilstmaking no effort to create a serious tertiary sector. (Technolgy Park,andtourism don't count.  Both have been handled so ineptly that they're ajoke.)  </ul><p>As far as I can see there is no economic stability.  What scares me more isthat this particular Government is scared - I can smell it from here. It israising the cost of Government services well above inflation and attemptingto sell anything that's not nailed down> These are acts of people who arenot thinking rationally.  Don't these people have any serious apoliticalanalysts?  Even Blind Freddy can see that they're digging themselves aneven deeper hole.<p>But saying that I suppose the adage of 'you get the government you deserve' is particularly appropriate here.  After all, the people did re-elect theLiberals.  However, I suppose you can't blame them - after all  there stilldoesn't seem to be a seriously effective Opposition.  <p>Yet I do blame the people of South Australia.  Obviously the cafe lifestylehas gone to their heads and a serious case of unimaginative apathy hastaken hold.  Doesn't anyone have any decent ideas or ambition to drag thestate out of the hole it finds itself in?  <p>Somewhere along the line  the population has decided that being a secondclass backwater, with second rate MPs leading the charge into mediocrity,is acceptable.  The last fresh idea was the MFP (and just look at howsucessful that was!).  This depression (mental as well as economic) hasbeen going on for far too long.  <p>I seriously hope that something happens soon to either put Adelaide out ofits misery or to do something positive.   <p>For what it's worth, I keep reading that London is the centre of theuniverse.

A media release outlining his itinerary anddetails of his departure and arrival was released on Friday afternoon,prior to his Sunday departure. Four media outlets contacted me on Saturdayto conduct an interview with him on Saturday night, prior to his depature -which he duly did.<p>That you or your journalists did not use your own initiative and contact meon that same day is, I  would argue, an issue you need to deal with.<p>To then, after failing to contact me, suggest the Premier left the state'as quietly as possible' is mischievous at the very least.<p>Your second incorrect assertion is that the Premier left for Japan 'rushingpast reporters, declining to answer questions.'<p>As you well know, this is file footage from a past interstate trip whichwas used on  one station only. <p>You also claim that the future of Mitsubishi was never in doubt - wrong!<p>As you would or should know - Mitsubishi Corporation has posted asignificant loss in the last financial year, and its exports of theDiamante have fallen considerably. Both of these issues have caused theGovernment great concern, and in the interest of the 5600 South Australiansemployed by the company, it was considered vital for the Premier to meetwith them and receive that assurance.<p>You also mock the cycling announcement. Yes you are right - it will involveeight member of the team visting the state for up to two weeks duration upto 8 times before the Sydney Olympic Games.<p>It is these kinds of intiatives which not only bring some economic benefitto the State, but place a focus on the sporting faciltiies we have to offerand allows us to market the State on the international market.<p>Already we have seen the Japanese Soccer team train in South Australia forthe World Cup - a move which pumped $3 million into the economy.<p>The Premier also held a full press conference on his arrival at AdelaideAirport. A media advice was issued the night before his arrival and againon the day of his arrival. Again a simple phone call to the Premier'soffice would have ensured you had the information you needed to attend themedia conference.<p>And finally - the Premier arrived in Adelaide on Thursday June 11 - a fullday after your article which was dated Wednesday June 10!<p>Vicki Thomson<br>Senior Adviser to the Premier<p><i>Thanks for your letter, Vicki. We don't think we were inaccurate, though.The Premier's departure time was sent to media but television stations hadto ring you on Saturday because no media conference was scheduled andjournalists wanted one. Reporters who could not make contact with you werenot notified of his television interviews, nor were they invited to attend.In Canberra, and in much of the civilized world, press secretaries informthe gallery of media conferences. <p>Vicki, you say we knew television images of the Premier rushing pastreporters, declining to answer questions, was file footage. Nope, we didn'tknow that. If true, that's very naughty of those television news people. Weshall speak to them about it. The Electric Newspaper has higher standards!<p>Regarding Mitsubishi's future, the company informs us it had no intention,and has no intention, of closing down its Adelaide operations, eitherbefore or after the Premier's visit to Japan.  <p>As far as overseas cyclists training in SA are concerned, we are yet to beconvinced it had anything to do with the Premier's trip to Japan.<p>Similarly, we have seen no evidence that the Japanese Soccer team'sdecision to train in South Australia was the result of the Premier's Japantrip.<p>We received no advice of the Premier's airport media conference on hisreturn, although you're right - we could have checked his arrival time withhis office.<p>And yes, the Premier did arrive in Adelaide on Thursday, not Wednesday, asour dateline said. Our computer mucked up the dateline.

I like it. Now that that's out of the way, let mevent my spleen. Yesterday, Rob Lucas announced that fees and charges willincrease by an average of 4.5 per cent in the next financial year. Much ofthis is because of increased costs in the public sector.<p>But wait a minute - weren't we told by this same Government that serviceprovision will get cheaper because of some 15,000 public servants beingshown the door? <p>The biggest ransparency in the Budget, however, relates to speeding fines.Expiation fees will increase by an average of 4.5 %, the same as theaverage of all other increases. The fine for exceeding the speed limit byless than 15 km/h goes up to $116.<p>There is no further proof needed that speeding fines are used not for roadsafety, but for revenue raising. <p>This is bad enough, but the consequences are worse still. This Governmentactually Budgets for millions of increased dollars in speeding fines.That's right - millions. The Government is not interested in making roadssafer, or in reducing accidents. It actually wants us to speed so that itcan collect increased fines. Where is the extra money going? Not on roadsafety programs! <p>As someone who has seen the conesequences, I think this is probably themost callous of any decision in this year's Budget.<p>John Hinden,<br>Burnside<p><hr noshade><p ALIGN=RIGHT><font size=-1><a href="#send_a_letter">Do you want to send a letter?</a></font><p><font size=-1>Thursday May 28, 1998</font><p><B><font size=+2>All's Wels that ends Wels</font></b><p>I write to express delight at the charmingly and amusingly written bookreviews of Denise Wels - I would willingly see many more of them.

This moment has come at great human cost.<p> Many people have lost their lives in the lead up to this shattering event- about  500 Indonesians and a third of the populations of East Timor andWest Papua as they have resisted the brutal occupation of their countriesby his regime.<p>All Australians who support human rights and decency will be celebratingwith their Indonesian, East Timorese and West Papuan brothers and sisters.<p>It must be seen as just a small step in the right direction - the firststep of a process to reverse great wrongs and to restore democracy.<p>The Indonesian students are to be congratulated for their level ofpolitical awareness. They understand stop-gap President Habibie only toowell. They know that he must go quickly if the process of democratisationis to be successful. Although Habibie is not part of the military, he ispart of the corrupt, undemocratic and brutal regime that has committedhorrific crimes against humanity and brought very low living standards toordinary Indonesians over the past 33 years.<p>He is also a very close friend and crony of General Suharto and will obeyhis dictates as do the puppets at the hands of the master puppeteer in thetraditional Indonesian and Malay shadow puppet plays, the wayang kulit.<p>The process must involve those many political parties and other groups thathave been excluded from political life during the last three decades - likethe alternative trade union movement, the Peoples Democratic Party, etc.Hundreds of political prisoners must be released - including Xanana Gusmao,the famous East Timor leader. Many prisoners have been incarcerated duringthe whole life of the regime.<p>The level of political awareness of the Indonesian students is in directcontrast to the position of Australia's political leaders. With regularmonotony and predictability over the past two weeks, they have beenpraising Suharto as a great leader. The message has been the same - whetherit has come from John Howard, Alexander Downer or Kym Beazely. <p>Australians listened almost dumbfounded when told by their Prime Ministerthat Suharto had brought peace and stability to Indonesia and the region.We would have to ask where has he been for the past 33 years? Whatstability is Mr Howard talking  about? Suharto's seizure of power in 1965was accompanied by a massive bloodbath and it led to genocide in twocountries in our region.<p>Why do our leaders refuse to acknowledge the massive loss of life, thebrutality and the pain and suffering to untold thousands of East Timorese,West Papuans and Indonesians caused by General Suharto and his militarydictatorship? There has been no stability in the region for the victims ofSuharto's and Habibie's crimes.<p>Andy Alcock<br>Campaign for an Independent East Timor (South Australia) Inc<p><hr noshade><p ALIGN=RIGHT><font size=-1><a href="#send_a_letter">Do you want to send a letter?</a></font><p><font size=-1>Friday May 15, 1998</font><p><B><font size=+2>Woomera on track: Kistler</font></b><p>	We read your article "A touch of hot air: the Woomera proposal" and wantedto express our appreciation for your interest in Kistler Aerospace and theWoomera project.

As for families and particularly women, under a Coalitiongovernment, the track record so far has been malevolent. <p>Moreover, the budget papers reveal more of this Government's agenda towardswomen.

Another newspaper's story about the Lake Eyre decisiontoday is headlined "Lake Eyre ruling welcomed". That's a long way shy of the truth.<p>	It could be that the South Australian Farmers Federation is pleased, but Ithink cockies will rue the day Lake Eyre missed out on being nominated forWorld Heritage Listing. Such listing would have provided all sorts ofprotection for the area, while still allowing grazing and other rights.What it may have stopped is the continual demand for more water to be drawnfrom the rivers which feed into the Lake Eyre basin. Cotton-growers, forexample, compete with graziers for water.<p>	I am not a member of the Australian Democrats, but I was pleased to hearone of its senators on radio yesterday, when she said the decision, by ourown Robert Hill, had more to do with the Coalition's drop in support inrural Australia than with environmental values.<p>	Hear, hear!<p>	I have been to Lake Eyre. I think it would have been good all round if wehad some Federal money under World Heritage to look after the area. All myinternational friends have heard of Lake Eyre. I am convinced it has thepotential to be a world-class tourist attraction. If today's Woomera dealcomes off (as reported in The Electric Newspaper) then it could well bethat hundreds if not thousands of people will come to the area to viewrocket launches, just as they do in the United States (including myself,for a Shuttle launch).

Fair enough.<p>	The PSA simultaneously campaigned (equally ineffectively) against cuts toa range of Government services like school closures and departmentaldownsizing.<p>	It seems to me that it costs less to manage our water now than it didbefore. The real question is whether this saving ought to be passed on towater users, or whether the saving to Government can be used for otherservices, like education and health.<p>	This doesn't mean there haven't been Government porkies told about thebenefits of privatising water.

Mr Reithcurrently has other issues on his plate that are looming larger in bothmedia reports and conversations around the country than the review of theAffirmative Action legislation.<p>There is a danger that this issue will slip by unnoticed, without the inputit deserves from individuals and organisations.  There is a danger that theAffirmative Action legislation may be quashed, to be replaced byself-regulation or market-based measures.<p>Interestingly, it has been shown that the Act has provided an impetus forchanges in management practice which have benefited all workers, and hasresulted, amongst other things, in greater transparency of personnelpolicies and practices.  Far from proving "costly for business", the Acthas led to economic benefits and cost savings through the improvement ofwork practices.<p>Nor has this legislation finished its work: Australia still has one of themost gender segregated workforces of all OECD countries and achievinggenuine pay equity remains a significant challenge.<p>Forget jokes about apologies; it would be more practical to ensure that wedo not lose legislation that has improved the workplace not only for thewomen of Australia but for all workers.<p>Information about the Review can be found at <A HREF="http://www.dwrsb.gov.au/">http://www.dwrsb.gov.au/</A>  (goto "What's New" 2/3/98).

The first is to summarise thesituation with regard to the consultancy being undertaken for the MarineFacilities Section - Department of Transport on the problem of the ingressseaweed at the Glenelg Patawalonga Marine Facilities. The second is toexpress my feelings over the way in which the workshop material preparedfor circulation between professional colleagues has been misused.<p>	The situation with regards to the consultancy is as follows:<p><ul><li> The work was commissioned on 19 March 1998 by Peter Swift, Manager ofMarine Facilities. This commission was in response to the proposal preparedby Environmental Management Services, to address the environment managementissues arising from the marine ingress problem in the Glenelg-Patawalongaarea. <li> Work on Phase 1 of a three-phase project commenced on 23 March 1998. Thefirst weeks activities involved a review of information on the developmentsat Glenelg held by the Marine Facilities Section and discussions withofficers of government on the issues and management responses. Workshopnotes were prepared on the basis of material held by the Department ofTransport.<li> A workshop of key government stakeholders was held on 30 March 1998 withthe purposes of further examining the issues; clarification of outstandingquestions and obtaining further information; and seeking agreement on theway forward for the second and third phases of the project.<li> The workshop notes can only be considered as preliminary comments andwere prepared to further discussion and to elicit information. Under nocircumstances could such materials be considered as a report of findings ofthe consultancy. Comments made in the notes reflect the review process andthe information available at that time. For anyone to use the notes in anyother way is a total misrepresentation of the material.<li> The workshop was highly productive and clear directions were obtained onthe best way to achieve a win-win solution to the removal and disposal ofingress materials. The solution identified by workshop participantsdemonstrates the collaborative way in which the government stakeholders areworking to overcome a longstanding problem. The solution will be to thebenefit of the user of the marine facilities at Glenelg and Adelaide'sbeach environment.<li> The result of the workshop clarified the situation with regards tofurther information on the marine ingress, the comparative costs of variousmanagement options and the benefit to be gained by using the seaweed' forshoreline protection activities.<li> On the basis of information obtained from the workshop, furtherinformation review, together with subsequently consultations withgovernment and non government stakeholders, a Phase 1 project a draftreport will be prepared. This draft document will be forwarded to keystakeholders for comment and critical review before being submitted to theManager, Marine Facilities.</ul><p>	The second of this memorandum is to express my surprise and disappointmentthat workshop notes were given to the West Beach Protesters. Further, I amdisgusted that the material has been forwarded to the media in the way thatit has. The notes for the workshop participants only, not for the public.<p>	In no way the workshop secret. Rather it is an example of collaborativegovernment demonstrating how the skills available across the SouthAustralian Government can be focussed on obtaining a solution to theingress of marine materials at the Glenelg Marine Facilities. Further, thesolution obtained through the consultancy, including the workshop process,will greatly assist the management of the West Beach facility by the amountof material that will need to be removed from that area.<p>	This has been an unfortunate misuse of workshop materials by persons witha set agenda. I trust that the situation as outlined above will help to putthe matter straight.<p>	Peter Waterman, Managing Director<br>		Environmental Management Services	<p><font size=-1>*This letter was addressed to the Minister for Government Enterprises,Michael Armitage, and forwarded for publication to The Electric Newspaperby the Minister's office.</font><p><hr noshade><p ALIGN=RIGHT><font size=-1><a href="#send_a_letter">Do you want to send a letter?</a></font><p>Thursday April 9, 1998<p><B><font size=+3>Tuna hearing today </font></b><p><img src="graphics/blue_fin_tuna.jpg" width=250 height=99 align=right vspace=3 hspace=3>	I write to you and your readers in the role of a concerned KangarooIslander.<p>	Today, the Development Assessment Commission is having its final day ofhearings into the proposed tuna feedlots by A. Raptis & Sons.<p>	Throughout the past three months, many islanders have been:<ul><li>voicing their opposition to this proposal by writing and telephoningcouncillors and politicians.<li> researching the facts of tuna feedlotting.<li> making presentations to the first DAC meeting last Thursday in Kingscote.</ul><p>	As our Mayor Janice Kelly stated last week, "I have never been lobbiedso strongly, been sent so much information, received so many telephonecalls and individual letters from members of the community."  <p>	I witnessed last Thursday our mayor and many islanders makingpresentations to this committee.  Some were emotional, some were technical,but all were factual.  In fact I know that the islanders were scrupulous inonly using information that could be verified.<p>	And here are some of the facts:<ul><li> Southern Bluefin Tuna (SBT) are being seriously overfished.<li> The proposed feedlots are fattening pens for wild tuna.  They are notbreeding farms.<li> No one has commercially bred SBT in captivity.  The Japanese tried butgave up.<li> SBT feedlots do attract sharks, dolphins, penguins, and sea lions. All ofthese are in the vicinity of the proposed feedlots.<li> There is much anecdotal evidence of these creatures being shot at BostonBay.<li> Kangaroo Island has an international clean green image.  One shark attackwill do untold damage to our tourist industry on KI, which supplies in thevicinity of 700 jobs.</ul><p>	By comparison, we have been accused of at worst lying, or just beinguninformed.  Yet our detractors don't produce any facts to support theirclaims, just insults and slander.<p>	It was listening to our local member of Parliament, Dean Brown, on the ABCradio news today, that prompted me to write to the press.  Minister Brownstated that there are 'wildly inaccurate claims' being made by theopponents to this proposal.  Hewent on to say that people should 'look at the facts and ignore theinaccurate emotive arguments' being used by some people.<p>	I have some questions of Minister Brown.  I want him to adhere to histitle of honourable and answer these:<ul><li> Why are you not representing your constituents in this matter, when thereis such clear and overwhelming opposition?<li> Why did you tell members of the Kangaroo Island Council on or about March4, 1998, that they were obliged to support the tuna applications?<li> What makes you think that your business qualifications and your cursorylook at the proposed sights puts you in a more informed position than theislanders who are considering all the overwhelming evidencefrom eminentscientists?</ul>	Yours sincerely,	<br>	Bob Huxtable.	<p><hr noshade><p ALIGN=RIGHT><font size=-1><a href="#send_a_letter">Do you want to send a letter?</a></font><p>Wednesday April 8, 1998<p><B><font size=+3>Debris or De'Bree?</font></b>     On Monday 2nd February E.H. de Bree from Utrecht University compared      the higher education system in the Netherlands to a dilapidated bus      that was becoming increasing difficult to service and maintain,      driving over routes that appear to be running out of paying      passengers.      <p>     On Sunday April 5th, Nicole de Bree from York University, compared      aspects of the English, Australian and Dutch university systems.     <p>     The universal problem in higher education, recognised by both of the      above contributors, is how to manage and meet costs.

The building itself stems from a period when artisticdetail had given way to base functionality. The lower floor has been alsobeen modified to look like a gaudy bathroom. Some of my opinion may becoloured by the 'tinsel and glitter cannon' that David Jones use to applydecoration, but I feel the building's retention would be of little value. <p>	I do however hope that a new development will bring greater character tothe city.

Having seen theshort-term political benefits (remember the billion dollar heritage fund,the vast majority of which went to buying Senators Harradine's andColston's vote, and various conservative-held electorates around thecountry?), the Government has now decided to flog off the rest.  <p>	And what for?  Well, after heartlessly trying to screw the aged and infirm ofthe community (a good many of whom spent a lifetime contributing to thebuilding up of one of the best telecommunications infrastructures andservices in the world), the Government suddenly wants to show everyone thatit's got a heart. <p>	Oh come on!  <p>	"We need the money to spend on hospitals and the like". Yeah, right. Inthe last year of operation prior to the first sale, Telstra paid $1.2billion in taxes to the Government. In one year. In that year, it invested$4.8 billion in the local manufacturing sector. In that year, it employed77,000 people.<p>	The maniacal fixation on efficiency as measured by the most rudimentaryand misleading means, that of viewing skilled people as costs to beminimised rather than as assets to be valued, results in beancounters andeconomists, secure and remote in their glass towers, recommending thecutting of swathes through these resources.<p>	The most breathtaking thing about all this is that while I and each andevery Australian owns Telstra as a public enterprise, it is proposed thatthe Government, without my consent, plans to take my company from me andhave the audacity to turn around and sell it back to me.  Usually, whensomething is taken from you without your consent, it is considered an actof theft. To turn around and sell it back a straight out con. <p>	Sadly, blinded by little dollar signs in their eyes, the well informed andclear-thinking punters of this great land will fall idealogically driven,cynical and damaging action. <p>	Jack Hoogland<br>	Adelaide<p><hr noshade><p ALIGN=RIGHT><font size=-1><a href="#send_a_letter">Do you want to send a letter?</a></font><p>Tuesday March 17, 1998<p><B><font size=+3>We like it</font></b><p>	I've been waiting a long time for this to happen and congrats go toHendrik and the team.<p>	 I hope the readers of this will get to air their frustration with thatpiece of crap (The Advertiser).

It seemsthat Mercury Energy, the main power provider to the city,is unable to restore full power till sometimenear the end of the month.

If I'drealised Randy was so skint I would have given him the 20 cent piecethat most people put in.<p>	I've had respect for the journalistic talents of most of those listed ascontributors and know or have worked/studied with those legal and labourstudies personnel who also wrote in this issue.<p>	However, hiding under a pseudonym when you're assassinating someone isnot on and does nothing to maintain the integrity of those involved withthis electronic journal.<p>	I expected more of journalists who have made their mark over the past 25years or so and who have shown themselves to be champions of causes inthe past.<p>	Can we expect something better in the future?<p>	Peter Baker<p><BLOCKQUOTE><i>Ahgggggg!

I furtherchallenge the author to give examples of the laws, consitutions,conventions or other mechanisms "created" from the above British blueprintby the "finest legal minds of the age" that were "selected" to convene onthe design of the current Commonwealth of Australia. <p>      	Surely the current constition is a better model from which to build thanthe system from which the original was constructed?  <p>     	The author's unsubstantiated assertion that each part of the constitutionhas its function will generate much opposition: for  example, theduplication of functions State-by-State, or the function of StateLegislative Councils (Queensland has thrived without one for more than 50years), to name just a couple.  <p>     	It is difficult to understand how John Rau can prefer the mechanisms ofselection used to represent constituencies at the original constitionalconventions last century to those used recently, or criticise the 1998delegates as being "not representative in any sense".    <p>   	As one who listened to the recent debates in the old Parliament House, Ido not agree that "proof of the foolishness in this whole process ... liesin the central debate about an elected Presidency".

National Shelter, the voice ofdissent,was defunded by the Minister responsible, Senator  Newman.<p>	The Senate inquiry found in favour of the community and it seemslikely tohave staved off the denigrating policy proposals to low income housingassistance at one level.<p>	However, as public housing has done for an incredibly long time, itfacesanother attack on a different front. The S.A. Human Services Minister DeanBrown wades in to keep the battlers on their toes in a smoke and mirrors,shuffling the deck chairs policy initiative that won't affect the current56 000 tenants (63 000 four years ago) or the 33 000 on the officialwaiting list (100 000 3 years ago).<p>	The plan includes forcing people out of "Trust housing' if they canaffordto live in the private rental market, combined with the introduction ofprobation, three and five-year term leases and 'stasi' like occupancymonitoring. This undermines the intrinsic benefit to the wider communityand the primacy of 'security of tenure'.<p>	If implemented,  it will result in a devastatingly social cost tothis State.<p>	The push will have a flow-on effect. Trust tenants moved on to theprivaterental market arbitrarily will enter a rental market at its tightest inS.A. history and this would create pressure on alternatives like dosshouses and caravan parks. Not quite the policy objective you had in mindMr. Brown?<p>	Fix the private rental market. Make it more like public housing whichattracts people and offers security and you will find these samecharacteristics will work for tenants and investors alike.<p>	Phil Harrison<br>	Woodville West<p><hr noshade><p ALIGN=RIGHT><font size=-1><a href="#send_a_letter">Do you want to send a letter?</a></font><p>Tuesday February 10, 1998<p> <B><font size=+3>Simon, where are you?</font></b><p>	Love to read Simons <a href="http://www.electric.on.net/news/05Feb-01.html">piece</a> - but the shortcut seems to have carked it!<p>	Phil Eastick<p><BLOCKQUOTE><i>	Yes, the road was under repair. <p>	The Team</i></BLOCKQUOTE><p><hr noshade><p ALIGN=RIGHT><font size=-1><a href="#send_a_letter">Do you want to send a letter?</a></font><p>Tuesday February 10, 1998<p> <B><font size=+3>Deadly</font></b><p>	Are you people serious? 11.55am Monday still showing 6-2-98  as Monday!!<p>	Regards<br>	Murray Scott..<p><BLOCKQUOTE><i>	Yeah, right, we know, we know.

While research into improving supplyand a better understanding of the life and environment of the tuna shouldcontinue, harvesting should be limited and controlled and internationalagreements beentered into, as is the case with whaling.  <p>	Importantly, demand must also be controlled, and  this necessarilyinvolves educating the market.  We have only to look  at the effects ofunregulated demand for such things as rhino horn and powdered tiger bonesto see the effects of that demand on the populations of rhino and tigerrespectively.<p>	Both creatures are on the verge of extinction, with numbers reduced tohundreds. In that respect, the Tuna Wars have at least put the issue in thepublic focus, surely an essential part of the education process.<p>	In that respect, the 'tuna barons', not wanting the public to know of theimminent extinction of the tuna stock, could well stand accused ofhastening the demise of this irreplaceable resource. It remains forgovernments, the fishing industry and the public to take steps to solve theproblem.<p>Jack Hoogland. <p><hr noshade><p ALIGN=RIGHT><font size=-1><a href="#send_a_letter">Do you want to send a letter?</a></font><p>	<B><font size=+3>Congratulations Team!</font></B>	<p>	Just found out about your site today, (via a plug on ABC-5AN) on JuliaLester's program.<p>	I will visit your site daily and following my cancellation of theAdvertiser, I trust your Electric Nespaper will fill that void.

I believe that the community is the major beneficiary.<p>Certainly there are benefits to the graduate, so I accept the principle that the student pays part of the cost, but certainly not the full cost. <p>Nevertheless, the negative aspects (or underperforming components) of our system are not due soely to Ministerial decisions. A significant number of the current problemsof the tertiary sector seem to be self generated. <p>Students are not merely clients of a university. They are also raw material, as tree sap is to tyre production. The clients, to me, are the people who pay the bills (taxpayers, parents and graduates) and the people who employ the human product (industry, taxpayers and parents). <p>Sincerely,<br>(name with-held by request)<p><a name="send_a_letter"><hr noshade></a><p><FORM ACTION="http://www.cobweb.com.au/cgi-bin/formmail/ELECTRICmail.pl" METHOD="POST"><input type=hidden name="recipient" value="editor@electric.on.net"><input type=hidden name="env_report" value="REMOTE_HOST,HTTP_USER_AGENT,REMOTE_ADDR"><input type=hidden name="sort" value="order:subject,realname,address,email,letter,env_report"><input type=hidden name="print_config" value="email,subject,realname"><input type=hidden name="redirect" value="http://www.electric.on.net"><CENTER><B><H1>send a letter to the editor</font></H1></B><table border=0><tr><td align=right><B>subject</B>:</td><td><INPUT NAME="subject" TYPE="text" SIZE="30"></td></tr><tr><td align=right><B>my name</B>:</td><td><INPUT NAME="realname" TYPE="text" SIZE="30"><BR></td></tr><tr><td align=right><B>my address</B>:</td><td><INPUT Type="text" NAME="address" size="30"><BR></td></tr><tr><td align=right><B>my email</B>:</td><td><INPUT Type="text" NAME="email" size="30"><BR></td></tr><tr><td valign=top align=right><b>my letter</b>:</td><td><TEXTAREA WRAP=VIRTUAL NAME="letter" ROWS=10 COLS=40></TEXTAREA></td></tr></table><INPUT NAME="submit" TYPE="submit" VALUE="Send"></FORM><CENTER><p><hr noshade><p><p><A HREF="http://www.electric.on.net">http://www.electric.on.net</A><p>&copy; This work is subject to copyright.
