# The Electric Newspaper Archive

## Overview

This is the archive of _The Electric Newspaper_, an early Australian online newspaper which was produced and published in Adelaide, South Australia in 1998. From anecdotal information this appears to be the first wholly online newspaper published in Australia, certainly Adelaide. 

Conceived during my time at early South Australian web design company _Virtual Artists_, _The Electric Newspaper_ was edited by ex-ABC journalist Hendrik Gout, and produced by Chris Joyner and myself.  There were many journalists, writers, photographers, illustrators and other contributors.

## Technical 

As it was developed in 1998, the style and standards for web sites were quite different, compared to today. HTML was at version 3, and all code was hand developed in _BBEdit_ and pushed to Apache hosting which was donated through Internode.

This repository hosts the original source code for the paper, which was broken during the archival process.  I will be attempting to clean up the HTML and republish in a clean format for the 25th anniversary of the paper.
